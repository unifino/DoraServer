00:00:12,100\nI'm Rose Byrne, and today I'm going to be\nreading\n\n4\n00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,260\nThe Tale of Peter Rabbit,\nwritten and illustrated by Beatrix Potter.\n\n5\n00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,560\nOnce upon a time there were four little rabbits,\n\n6\n00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,120\nand their names were\nFlopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.\n\n7\n00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,800\nThey lived with their Mother in a sand-bank,\nunderneath the root of a very big fir tree.\n\n8\n00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,300\n\"Now my dears,\" said the old Mrs. Rabbit one\nmorning,\n\n9\n00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,300\n\"you may go into the fields or down the lane,\n\n10\n00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,240\nbut don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden.\n\n11\n00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,780\nYour Father had an accident there.\n\n12\n00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,600\nHe was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"\n\n13\n00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,300\n\"Now run along, and don't get into mischief.\n\n14\n00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,720\nI am going out.\"\n\n15\n00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,149\nThen old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her\numbrella,\n\n16\n00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:57,920\nand went through the wood to the baker's.\n\n17\n00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,660\nShe bought a loaf of brown bread and five\ncurrant buns.\n\n18\n00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,820\nFlopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail,\nwho were good little bunnies,\n\n19\n00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,600\nwent down the lane to gather blackberries.\n\n20\n00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,920\nBut Peter, who was very naughty,\n\n21\n00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,960\nran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden,\n\n22\n00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,000\nand squeezed under the gate!\n\n23\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,900\nFirst he ate some lettuces\nand then some French beans,\n\n24\n00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,500\nand then he ate some radishes.\n\n25\n00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,979\nAnd then, feeling rather sick,\nhe went to look for some parsley.\n\n26\n00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,420\nBut round the end of a cucumber frame,\n\n27\n00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,160\nwhom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!\n\n28\n00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,520\nMr. McGregor was on his hands and knees \nplanting out young cabbages,\n\n29\n00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,720\nbut he jumped up and ran after Peter,\nwaving a rake and calling out\n\n30\n00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,780\n\"Stop thief!\"\n\n31\n00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,259\nPeter was most dreadfully frightened.\n\n32\n00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,540\nHe rushed all over the garden,\nfor he had forgotten the way back to the gate.\n\n33\n00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,960\nHe lost one of his shoes amongst the cabbages,\n\n34\n00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,800\nand the other shoe amongst the potatoes.\n\n35\n00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,300\nAfter losing them, he ran on four legs and\nwent faster,\n\n36\n00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,820\nso I think he might have got away altogether\n\n37\n00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,880\nif he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net,\n\n38\n00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,219\nand got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.\n\n39\n00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:19,129\nIt was a blue jacket with brass buttons;\nit was quite new.\n\n40\n00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:22,800\nPeter gave himself up for lost,\nand shed big tears,\n\n41\n00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,180\nbut his sobs were overheard by some friendly\nsparrows,\n\n42\n00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,380\nwho flew to him in great excitement, and implored\nhim to exert himself.\n\n43\n00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,680\nMr. McGregor came up with a sieve,\nwhich he intended to pop upon the top of Peter.\n\n44\n00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,730\nBut Peter wriggled out just in time,\nleaving his jacket behind him.\n\n45\n00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,640\nAnd rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped\ninto a can.\n\n46\n00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,060\nIt would have been a beautiful thing\nto hide in,\n\n47\n00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,120\nif it had not had so much water in it.\n\n48\n00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,960\nMr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was\nsomewhere in the tool-shed,\n\n49\n00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,300\nperhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot.\n\n50\n00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,400\nHe began to turn them over carefully, looking\nunder each.\n\n51\n00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,820\nPresently, Peter sneezed.\n\n52\n00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,300\n\"Kertyschoo!\"\n\n53\n00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,140\nMr. McGregor was after him in no time\n\n54\n00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,400\nand tried to put his foot upon Peter,\nwho jumped out of a window,\n\n55\n00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,060\nupsetting three plants.\n\n56\n00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,609\nThe window was too small for Mr. McGregor,\nand he was tired of running after Peter.\n\n57\n00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,260\nHe went back to his work.\n\n58\n00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,020\nPeter sat down to rest.\n\n59\n00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,480\nHe was out of breath and trembling with fright,\n\n60\n00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,100\nand he had not the least idea which way to go.\n\n61\n00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,140\nAlso he was very damp with sitting in that\ncan.\n\n62\n00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,433\nAfter a time he began to wander about,\n\n63\n00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:43,409\ngoing lippity—lippity—not very fast,\nand looking all around.\n\n64\n00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,900\nHe found a door in a wall, but it was locked,\n\n65\n00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,360\nand there was no room for a fat\nlittle rabbit to squeeze underneath.\n\n66\n00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,449\nAn old mouse was running in and out over the\nstone doorstep,\n\n67\n00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:57,889\ncarrying peas and beans to her family in the\nwood.\n\n68\n00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:02,019\nPeter asked her the way to the gate,\nbut she had such a large pea in her mouth\n\n69\n00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,170\nthat she could not answer.\n\n70\n00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,819\nShe only shook her head at him.\n\n71\n00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,240\nPeter began to cry.\n\n72\n00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,040\nThen he tried to find his way straight across\nthe garden,\n\n73\n00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,510\nbut he became more and more puzzled.\n\n74\n00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,659\nPresently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor\nfilled his water-cans.\n\n75\n00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:24,330\nA white cat was staring at some gold-fish.\n\n76\n00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,189\nShe sat very, very still,\nbut now and then the tip of her tail twitched\n\n77\n00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:32,669\nas if it were alive.\n\n78\n00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:35,990\nPeter thought it best to go away without speaking\nto her.\n\n79\n00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,569\nHe had heard about cats from his cousin,\n little Benjamin Bunny.\n\n80\n00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:43,259\nHe went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly,\n\n81\n00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,660\nquite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe.\n\n82\n00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,420\nScr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.\n\n83\n00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,880\nPeter scuttered underneath the bushes.\n\n84\n00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,320\nBut presently, as nothing happened,\nhe came out,\n\n85\n00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,040\nand climbed upon a wheelbarrow\nand peeped over.\n\n86\n00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,300\nThe first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing\nonions.\n\n87\n00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,710\nHis back was turned towards Peter,\nand beyond him was the gate!\n\n88\n00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,600\nPeter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow\n\n89\n00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,940\nand started running as fast as he could go,\n\n90\n00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,620\nalong a straight walk behind some black-currant\nbushes.\n\n91\n00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,000\nMr. McGregor caught sight of him in the corner,\nbut Peter did not care.\n\n92\n00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,620\nHe slipped underneath the gate, and was safe\nat last in the wood outside the garden.\n\n93\n00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,260\nMr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and\nthe shoes for a scare-crow\n\n94\n00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,939\nto frighten the blackbirds.\n\n95\n00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,640\nPeter never stopped running or looked behind\nhim till he got home to the big fir-tree.\n\n96\n00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,580\nHe was so tired that he flopped down upon\nthe nice soft sand\n\n97\n00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,660\non the floor of the rabbit-hole\nand shut his eyes.\n\n98\n00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,720\nHis mother was busy cooking.\n\n99\n00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,759\nShe wondered what he had done with his clothes.\n\n100\n00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,629\nIt was the second little jacket and pair of\nshoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!\n\n101\n00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,150\nI am sorry to say that Peter was not very\nwell during the evening.\n\n102\n00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,210\nHis mother put him to bed,\nand made some camomile tea.\n\n103\n00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,360\nAnd she gave a dose of it to Peter!\n\n104\n00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,080\n\"One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.\"\n\n105\n00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,760\nBut Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail\n\n106\n00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,420\nhad bread and milk and\nblackberries for supper.\n\n107\n00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,040\nThe End\n\n108\n00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,300\nThank you so much for joining me in reading\nPeter Rabbit.\n\n109\n00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,060\nIt's one

The recipe for a tomato-and-veggie filled soup.\n\n45\n00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,400\nHe was sure the tomatoes would make it look bloody and gloopy, just like a zombie dish.\n\n46\n00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,940\nHis parents were going to devour it!\n\n47\n00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,000\nMo chopped and diced,\n\n48\n00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,940\nblended and pureed,\n\n49\n00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680\nperfected and poured.\n\n50\n00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,720\nFinally, the soup was finished.\n\n51\n00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,580\nMo carefully shuffled it over to the house for dinner...\n\n52\n00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,480\n...where he found a feast fit for a zombie.\n\n53\n00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,480\nMo! You're just in time.\n\n54\n00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,280\nTry some arm-panadas, mi amor. Prime cuts!\n\n55\n00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,540\nMira, I made spicy man-naise.\n\n56\n00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,600\nI made something for you to try too. It's called blood bile bisque.\n\n57\n00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,740\nBone Appétit gave it five brains.\n\n58\n00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,020\nSmells strange. Looks delightful!\n\n59\n00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,960\nCinco brains! Must be delicioso!\n\n60\n00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,400\nThey dug in.\n\n61\n00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,700\nMo closed his eyes and sucked in his breath. This was it.\n\n62\n00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,760\nThey'd savor the soup. They'd ask for más.\n\n63\n00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,440\nMo imagined breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks. All VEGETABLES!\n\n64\n00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,900\nRaw, cooked, steamed, and fried. Forever and ever.\n\n65\n00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,620\nHe saw all his dreams coming true.\n\n66\n00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,060\nUntil...\n\n67\n00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,000\nMo's parents did not like the soup.\n\n68\n00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,880\nNot. One. Bit.\n\n69\n00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,280\n¡Dios mío! This soup tastes like... like... vegetables!\n\n70\n00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,300\nYuck!\n\n71\n00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,400\nMo's heart sank to his toes. His plan was a bust.\n\n72\n00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:19,900\nHow many times do we have to tell you that zombies don't eat veggies?!\n\n73\n00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,460\nMaybe other zombies don't eat vegetables, but I do.\n\n74\n00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,300\nMom and dad, I'm different.\n\n75\n00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,860\nBut I'm still me. Mauricio Romero.\n\n76\n00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,240\nYour niño.\n\n77\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,060\nYour Mo.\n\n78\n00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,560\nMo reminded his parents that he liked chasing humans as they ran in marathons.\n\n79\n00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,280\nAnd he promised he'd always cheer for Dad during championship brain-eating competitions.\n\n80\n00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,240\nHe also loved doing the zombie shuffle under the moonlight with Mom.\n\n81\n00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,720\nHe was a zombie. A Romero.\n\n82\n00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,580\nHe just liked to eat vegetables.\n\n83\n00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,780\nMo's parents loved their son and finally accepted that it was okay to be different.\n\n84\n00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,500\nThey even promised Mo they would eat more veggies— for him.\n\n85\n00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,900\nBut only a teeny, tiny bit.\n\n86\n00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,340\nThe Romeros knew that most zombies don't eat veggies.\n\n87\n00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,000\nBut they were more than zombies.\n\n88\n00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,820\nThey were a family.\n\n89\n00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,720\nThe end.\n\n90\n00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,640\nI love this story for many reasons. First of all, it is perfectly fine to be different,\n\n91\n00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,780\nbecause in a loving family, you'll be accepted.\n\n92\n00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,900\nAnd it's okay to express yourself.\n\n93\n00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,600\nAnd as Mo showed us, he was very respectful of his parents,\n\n94\n00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,440\nand they were able to come together and compromise and share respect for each other.\n\n95\n00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,520\nSo don't ever forget kids, be true to yourself, be honest, express yourself,\n\n96\n00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,800\nand don't be afraid to be authentic.\n\n97\n00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,420\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:12,900\nHi, I'm Al Gore and this is part of the BookPALS program, sponsored by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:24,460\nAnd today, I'm going to read you this book, written and illustrated by William Steig, it's called \"Brave Irene.\"\n\n3\n00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,340\nHere's how it begins...\n\n4\n00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:40,820\nMrs. Bobbin, the dressmaker, was tired and had a bad headache, but she still managed to sew the last stiches in the gown she was making.\n\n5\n00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:49,600\n\"It's the most beautiful dress in the whole world!\" said her daughter, Irene. \"The duchess will love it.\"\n\n6\n00:00:49,600 --> 00:01:00,180\n\"It is nice,\" her mother admitted. \"But, dumpling, it's for tonight's ball, and I don't have the strength to bring it. I feel sick.\"\n\n7\n00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,100\n\"Poor Mama,\" said Irene. \"I can get it there!\"\n\n8\n00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,880\n\"No, cupcake, I can't let you,\" said Mrs. Bobbin.\n\n9\n00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:18,020\n\"Such a huge package, and it's such a long way to the palace. Besides, it's starting to snow.\"\n\n10\n00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,560\n\"But I love snow,\" Irene insisted.\n\n11\n00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:29,600\nShe coaxed her mother into bed, covered her with two quilts, and added a blanket for her feet.\n\n12\n00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,890\nThen she fixed some tea with lemon and honey and put more wood in the stove.\n\n13\n00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:46,950\nWith great care, Irene took the splendid gown down from the dummy and packed it in a big box with plenty of tissue paper.\n\n14\n00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:56,100\n\"Dress warmly, pudding,\" her mother called in a weak voice, \"and don't forget to button up. It's cold out there, and windy.\"\n\n15\n00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:05,050\nIrene put on her fleece-lined boots, her red hat and muffler, her heavy coat, and her mittens.\n\n16\n00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:13,909\nShe kissed her mother's hot forehead six times, then once again, made sure she was tucked in snugly,\n\n17\n00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:19,640\nand slipped out with the big box, shutting the door firmly behind her.\n\n18\n00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,660\nIt really was cold outside, very cold.\n\n19\n00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:33,419\nThe wind whirled the falling snow-flakes about, this way, that way, and into Irene's squinting face.\n\n20\n00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,800\nShe set out on the uphill path to Farmer Bennett's sheep pasture.\n\n21\n00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:46,100\nBy the time she got there, the snow was up to her ankles and the wind was worse.\n\n22\n00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,209\nIt hurried her along and made her stumble.\n\n23\n00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,940\nIrene resented this; the box was problem enough.\n\n24\n00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,700\n\"Easy does it!\" she cautioned the wind, leaning back hard against it.\n\n25\n00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,799\nBy the middle of the pasture, the flakes were falling thicker.\n\n26\n00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:15,449\nNow the wind drove Irene along so rudely she had to hop, skip, and go helter-skeltering over the knobby ground.\n\n27\n00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:20,580\nCold snow sifted into her boots and chilled her feet.\n\n28\n00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,640\nShe pushed out her lip and hurried on. This was an important errand.\n\n29\n00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,760\nWhen she reached Apple Road, the wind decided to put on a show.\n\n30\n00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,520\nIt ripped branches from trees and flung them about, swept up and scattered the fallen snow,\n\n31\n00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,340\ngot in front of Irene to keep her from moving ahead.\n\n32\n00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,060\nIrene turned around and pressed on backwards.\n\n33\n00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:58,260\n\"Go home!\" the wind squalled. \n\"Irene... go hooome...\"\n\n34\n00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,379\n\"I will do no such thing,\" she snapped. \"No such thing, you wicked wind!\"\n\n35\n00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:14,020\n\"Go ho-o-ome,\" the wind yodeled.\n\"GO HO-WO-WOME,\" it shrieked, \"or else.\"\n\n36\n00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,120\nFor a short second, Irene wondered if she shouldn't heed the wind's warning.\n\n37\n00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,180\nBut no! The gown had to get to the duchess!\n\n38\n00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,060\nThe wind wrestled her for the package-- walloped it, twisted it, shook it, snatched at it.\n\n39\n00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,180\nBut Irene wouldn't yield. \"It's my mother's work!\" she screamed.\n\n40\n00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:45,480\nThen-- oh, woe!-- the box was wrenched from her mittened grasp and sent bumbling along in the snow.\n\n41\n00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,600\nIrene went after it.\n\n42\n00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,760\nShe pounced and took hold, but the ill-tempered wind ripped the box open.\n\n43\n00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,760\nThe ball gown flounced out and went waltzing through the powdered air with tissue-paper attendants.\n\n44\n00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,780\nIrene clung to the empty box and watched the beautiful gown disappear.\n\n45\n00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:17,599\nHow could anything so terribly wrong be allowed to happen? Tears froze on her lashes.\n\n46\n00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:25,689\nHer dear mother's hard work, all those days of measuring, cutting, pinning, stitching... for this?\n\n47\n00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:34,719\nAnd the poor duchess! Irene decided she would have to trudge on with just the box and explain everything in person.\n\n48\n00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:44,240\nShe went shuffling through the snow. Would her mother understand, she wondered, that it was the wind's fault, not hers?\n\n49\n00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,149\nWould the duchess be angry? The wind was howling like a wild animal.\n\n50\n00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:59,990\nSuddenly Irene stepped in a hole and fell over with a twisted ankle. She blamed it on the wind.\n\n51\n00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:07,220\n\"Keep quiet!\" She scolded. \"You've done enough damage already. You've spoiled everything! Everything!\"\n\n52\n00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,069\nThe wind swallowed up her words.\n\n53\n00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:17,780\nShe sat in the snow in great pain, afraid she wouldn't be able to go on.\n\n54\n00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,079\nBut she managed to get to her feet and start moving. It hurt.\n\n55\n00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:31,990\nHome, where she longed to be, where she and her mother could be warm together, was far behind.\n\n56\n00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:41,639\nIt's got to be closer to the palace, she thought. But where any place was in all this snow, she couldn't be sure.\n\n57\n00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:50,460\nShe plowed on, dragging furrows with her sore foot. The short winter day was almost done.\n\n58\n00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,490\n\"Am I still going the right way?\" she wondered. There was no one around to advise her.\n\n59\n00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:07,780\nWhoever else there was in this snow-covered world was far, far away, and safe indoors-- even the animals in their burrows. She went plodding on.\n\n60\n00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:15,900\nSoon night took over. She knew in the dark that the muffled snow was still falling-- she could feel it.\n\n61\n00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:24,520\nShe was cold and alone in the middle of nowhere. Irene was lost.\n\n62\n00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:32,280\nShe had to keep moving. She was hoping she'd come to a house, any house at all, and be taken in.\n\n63\n00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,800\nShe badly needed to be in someone's arms. The snow was above her knees now.\n\n64\n00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,379\nShe shoved her way through it, clutching the empty box.\n\n65\n00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:52,720\nShe was asking how long a small person could keep this struggle up, when she realized it was getting lighter.\n\n66\n00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,929\nThere was a soft glow coming from somewhere below her.\n\n67\n00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:05,340\nShe waded toward this glow, and soon was gazing down a long slope at a brightly lit mansion.\n\n68\n00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,460\nIt had to be the palace!\n\n69\n00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:18,100\nIrene pushed forward with all her strength and-- sloosh! thwump!-- she plunged downward and was buried.\n\n70\n00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,990\nShe had fallen off a little cliff.\n\n71\n00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,100\nOnly her hat and the box in her hands stuck out above the snow.\n\n72\n00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:35,100\nEven if she could call for help, no one would hear her. Her body shook. Her teeth chattered.\n\n73\n00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:44,120\n\"Why not freeze to death,\" she thought, \"and let all these troubles end.\"\nWhy not? She was already buried.\n\n74\n00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:55,540\nAnd never see her mother's face again? Her good mother who smelled like fresh-baked bread?\n\n75\n00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:05,780\nIn an explosion of fury, she flung her body about to free herself and was finally able to climb up on her knees and look around.\n\n76\n00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:13,170\nHow to get down to that glittering palace? As soon as she raised the question, she had the answer.\n\n77\n00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,380\nShe laid the box down and climbed aboard.\n\n78\n00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,400\nBut it pressed into the snow and stuck.\n\n79\n00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:33,080\nShe tried again, and this time, instead of climbing on, she leaped. The box shot forward, like a sled.\n\n80\n00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:41,220\nThe wind raced after Irene but couldn't keep up. In a moment she would be with people again, inside where it was warm.\n\n81\n00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,960\nThe sled slowed and jerked to a stop on paving stones.\n\n82\n00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,460\nThe time had come to break the bad news to the duchess.\n\n83\n00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:00,160\nWith the empty box clasped to her chest, Irene strode nervously toward the palace.\n\n84\n00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,240\nBut then her feet stopped moving and her mouth fell open. She stared.\n\n85\n00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:16,200\nMaybe this was impossible, yet there it was, a little way off and over to the right, hugging the trunk of a tree--\n\n86\n00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,660\nThe beautiful ball gown! The wind was holding it there.\n\n87\n00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,420\n\"Mama!\" Irene shouted. \"Mama, I found it!\"\n\n88\n00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:37,660\nShe managed somehow, despite the wind's meddling, to get the gown off the tree and back in its box.\n\n89\n00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:46,880\nAnd in another moment she was at the door of the palace. She knocked twice with the big brass knocker.\n\n90\n00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880\nThe door opened and she burst in.\n\n91\n00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,120\nShe was welcomed by cheering servants and a delirious duchess.\n\n92\n00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,420\nThey couldn't believe she had come over the mountain in such a storm, all by herself.\n\n93\n00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,390\nShe had to tell the whole story, every detail. And she did.\n\n94\n00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,620\nThen she asked to be taken right back to her sick mother.\n\n95\n00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:17,970\nBut it was out of the question, they said; the road that ran around the mountain wouldn't be cleared until morning.\n\n96\n00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:27,110\n\"Don't fret, child,\" said the duchess. \"Your mother is surely sleeping now. We'll get you there first thing tomorrow.\"\n\n97\n00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:35,490\nIrene was given a good dinner as she sat by the fire, the moisture steaming off her clothes.\n\n98\n00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:45,100\nThe duchess, meanwhile, got into her freshly ironed gown before the guests began arriving in their sleighs.\n\n99\n00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:55,620\nWhat a wonderfull ball it was! The duchess in her new gown was like a bright star in the sky.\n\n100\n00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,100\nIrene in her ordinary dress was radiant.\n\n101\n00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:08,780\nShe was swept up into dances by handsome aristocrats, who kept her feet off the floor to spare her ankle.\n\n102\n00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,500\nHer mother would enjoy hearing all about it.\n\n103\n00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:24,740\nEarly the next morning, when snow had long since ceased falling, Mrs. Bobbin woke from a good night's sleep feeling much improved.\n\n104\n00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:34,140\nShe hurried about and got a fire going in the cold stove. Then she went to look in on Irene.\n\n105\n00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,980\nBut Irene's bed was empty! She ran to the window and gazed at the white landscape.\n\n106\n00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,120\nNo one out there. Snow powder fell from the branch of a tree.\n\n107\n00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:55,060\n\"Where is my child?\" Mrs. Bobbin cried. She whipped on her coat to go out and find her.\n\n108\n00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,460\nWhen she pulled the door open, a wall of drift faced her.\n\n109\n00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:09,000\nBut peering over it, she could see a horse-drawn sleigh hastening up the path.\n\n110\n00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:18,630\nAnd seated on the sleigh, between two large footmen, was Irene herself, asleep but smiling.\n\n111\n00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,940\nWould you like to hear the rest?\n\n112\n00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,940\nWell, there was a bearded doctor in the back of the sleigh...\n\n113\n00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:38,880\nand the duchess had sent Irene's mother a ginger cake with white icing, some oranges and a pineapple, and spice candy of many flavors,\n\n114\n00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:48,000\nalong with a note saying how much she cherished her gown, and what a brave and loving person Irene was.\n\n115\n00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,950\nWhich, of course, Mrs. Bobbin knew. Better than the duchess.\n\n116\n00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,440\nI hope you enjoyed this book, \"Brave Irene.\"",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:01,809 --> 00:00:10,569\nHey there, I'm Amber Tamblyn and welcome to BookPALS Storyline Online, sponsored by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:23,460\nToday I'm going to be reading \"White Socks Only,\" written by Evelyn Coleman and illustrated by Tyrone Geter.\n\n3\n00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:31,280\n\"Grandma, can I walk into town by myself? I asked, one hot summer's day.  I knew what she was going to say.\n\n4\n00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:38,860\nShe was going to tell a story. Not just any story, but my favorite story.\n\n5\n00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:46,800\nI watched her turn toward her spit can. Ping! The snuff juice hit the bottom, sounding like a chime.\n\n6\n00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:55,050\nShe rocked one or two times, her eyes closed, and then she looked up at me.\n\n7\n00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,560\n\"You know you aint' big enough to walk into no town alone, girl. I sho' don't know why you asking me that.\n\n8\n00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,640\nYou ain't big enough 'til you gon' do some good there.\"\n\n9\n00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:13,920\nI smiled and plopped down on the step. She was about to begin the story. Grandma laughed.\n\n10\n00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,080\nYou know... when I was a little girl, like yourself, I sneaked into town once.\n\n11\n00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:28,020\nYep, all by myself. Wasn't planning on doing no good. Had just been waiting for a scorching hot day.\n\n12\n00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:36,000\nI had two eggs hid in my pockets. Not to eat, mind you. But to see if what folks said was true.\n\n13\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,990\nI slipped on my finest Sunday dress and my shiny black patent-leather shoes and my clean white socks.\n\n14\n00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,420\nI pulled my plaits back with a bow. Why, I thought I looked pretty grown-up.\n\n15\n00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:56,160\nLord, you shoulda seen me strutting, the dust flying behind me! I had to hold my arms steady on account of them eggs, though.\n\n16\n00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,140\nNow that I think about it, I musta been a mighty funny sight.\n\n17\n00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:09,840\nI sneaked on up that road a-singin', \"Jump back Sally, Sally, Sally. Walking up the alley, alley, alley\" to nobody but myself.\n\n18\n00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,400\nAnd child, was it hot! On that kind of day a firecracker might light up by itself.\n\n19\n00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,700\nI was feeling pretty fine until I spotted that old Chicken Man, sitting on his porch, with his mouth like a smile.\n\n20\n00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,000\nI just looked down at the dirt.\n\n21\n00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,340\nMy mama had told me how the Chicken Man still did things he knowed all the way from Africa.\n\n22\n00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,480\nStuff that his grandmother done taught him.\n\n23\n00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,960\nMama also had told me he could heal the sick by the laying on of his hands.\n\n24\n00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,109\nAnd that one time he made a blind man see just by looking deep into his eyes.\n\n25\n00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:54,819\nAnd folks said he turned people into chickens if he didn't feel what they were doing was right. That's why he was called the Chicken Man.\n\n26\n00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,620\nI was kinda scared he might think I wasn't doing right, so I started walking faster.\n\n27\n00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,790\nI still held my arms out steady though, so I wouldn't break the eggs.\n\n28\n00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,860\nAnyway, when I got to town, I didn't see many folk that I knew.\n\n29\n00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,900\nI wandered around, with my mouth gaped open, looked at the white women in their fancy hats.\n\n30\n00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,020\nThat's when I saw Mama's friend Miss Nancy turning the corner.\n\n31\n00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:27,880\nI was going to sho nuff be in trouble if she saw me. She told Mama everything.\n\n32\n00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,660\nSo I took off running toward the first big tree I saw and hid behind it.\n\n33\n00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:41,360\nI stayed there for a minute, panting, until I saw Miss Nancy walk out of sight. Then I tiptoed out.\n\n34\n00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,679\nBut in my rush I'd burst one of my eggs, and it was slinking down my dress and legs.\n\n35\n00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:51,209\nI figured I'd better do what I come to do and get back home.\n\n36\n00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:57,819\nI was standing in front of this big old building where there was a statue of a soldier sitting up on a horse.\n\n37\n00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:04,619\nI read what it said on the building, \"Cole County Courthouse, Mississippi.\"\n\n38\n00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:13,020\nI carefully pulled my egg out of my pocket. Right there, I cracked it one time against the horse's leg.\n\n39\n00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:19,100\nThe egg's insides dropped to the hot cement. I knelt down with my face close.\n\n40\n00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,030\nI watched that egg like the old men watch the checkers before making a move.\n\n41\n00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,300\nFor a minute I thought it wasn't gon' do nothing.\n\n42\n00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,700\nThen right around the edges, I saw it. One little bit was turning white.\n\n43\n00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,320\nNext the white creeped wider and the yellow began to bubble.\n\n44\n00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,660\nBy golly, I was frying an egg on the cement just like folks said! I jumped up and started dancing and prancing.\n\n45\n00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,520\nIt was time to go home now. I'd done it. It was all over, and it was true.\n\n46\n00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,260\nIt could get so hot you could fry an egg on the sidewalk.\n\n47\n00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,809\nI started walking and wiping sweat from my face, with the eggy part of my dress sticking to me every time I took a step.\n\n48\n00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:05,460\nMy mouth was as dry as dirt, and I was mighty thirsty.\n\n49\n00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,640\nThat's when I spotted the water fountain.  It had a little stepstool so children could climb up to drink.\n\n50\n00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,380\nBut on the fountain was a sign that read, \"Whites Only.\"\n\n51\n00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,880\nWell, I knew what that meant. So I sat down in the grass and took off my shiny black patent-leather shoes.\n\n52\n00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:31,720\nNow I only had on my clean white socks. I stepped up on that stool with those white socks hugging my feet.\n\n53\n00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:42,160\nI was slurping up that water mighty fast when this big white man with a black and white bandana 'round his neck grabbed me off the stool and pushed me to the ground.\n\n54\n00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,760\nThe white man pointed to the sign and yelled at me,\n\n55\n00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,160\n\"Can't you read, girl? Why, I'm gon' whup you 'til you can't sit down.\"\n\n56\n00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,120\nHis big fingers fumbled and tugged at his belt.\n\n57\n00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,600\nI began to cry as a crowd of white people gathered 'round. They were all staring at me.\n\n58\n00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,960\nSeeing all the people made me real scared, and I cried louder.\n\n59\n00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,910\nI couldn't understand what the white man was so mad about. I was wearing my white socks.\n\n60\n00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:24,980\nAn old black woman from my church stepped through the crowd. She wasn't wearing anything white, but she untied her shoes and took them off.\n\n61\n00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,460\nShe stepped up to the fountain, bent way down, and took a drink.\n\n62\n00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:38,380\nI knew the man was gon' yell at her. And he did. \"I'm gon' have to whup you too, ain't I?\" he shouted.\n\n63\n00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:46,060\nBut then other black folk started coming over, removing their shoes and drinking from the fountain.\n\n64\n00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,880\nThey had on clean-looking green socks and yellow socks and red socks and blue socks.\n\n65\n00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,520\nOf course, the big man with the bandana kept right on yelling. His face got red as fire.\n\n66\n00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,960\nHe was snorting through his nose like a bull does when it's gon' charge.\n\n67\n00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:14,919\nOther white folk came up and started yelling at us, too.  By that time, the big man had whipped his belt out of his pants.\n\n68\n00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,199\nHe was hitting me and everybody else who was close.\n\n69\n00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:28,460\nNone of the black people moved. They just covered their faces. I sat there sobbing, holdin' my arms over my head.\n\n70\n00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:37,020\nAll of a sudden everybody got quiet like they was gon' pray in church. Even the white people.\n\n71\n00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,300\nI peeped out through my arms.\n\n72\n00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:47,260\nThe black people and the white people were moving aside. The Chicken Man was coming through.\n\n73\n00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,980\nHe was slowly tapping his way toward me.\n\n74\n00:07:51,980 --> 00:08:00,220\nWhen he got close, he stopped. He looked at me from the top of my head down to my white socks.\n\n75\n00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:07,040\nThen he bent over and pulled off his black shoes, his face squeezing up.\n\n76\n00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,760\nHe had on the cleanest white socks you ever seen.\n\n77\n00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,540\nHe stepped up on the stool. He didn't have to bend over very far because he was so short.\n\n78\n00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,860\nHe drank a long time from that fountain.\n\n79\n00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,440\nI held my breath. So did everyone else.\n\n80\n00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,220\nThe Chicken Man lifted his head.\n\n81\n00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,330\nHe turned around, smiling, and slowly stepped down off the stool.\n\n82\n00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,240\nWithout a word, he pointed a crooked finger at the white man.\n\n83\n00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:53,190\nThe white man's belt was down by his side now, clasped tightly in his fist. He was as still as the statue.\n\n84\n00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,540\nThe old Chicken Man helped me up. He took out a white handkerchief and wiped off my face.\n\n85\n00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:06,700\n\"There, there now, child. It's time for you to go on home. You did all right.\"\n\n86\n00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,680\nHe handed me a chicken feather out of the brim of his hat and hobbled away.\n\n87\n00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:20,520\nAll the black people surrounded me. They were all crying and hugging me. Then they took me home.\n\n88\n00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,940\nWhen they told Mama what had happened, she just broke out laughing.\n\n89\n00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:31,680\nShe said, \"Well I guess you can go to town by yourself now, 'cause you're old enough to do some good.\"\n\n90\n00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:38,500\nNobody ever again saw the big white man who had whipped us.\n\n91\n00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:45,580\nNone of us dared ask about the big chicken flapping 'round the courthouse near the water fountain, neither.\n\n92\n00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,800\nAnd from then on, the \"Whites Only\" sign was gone from that water fountain forever.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:10,889\nWelcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:17,500\nMy name is James Earl Jones. You might wonder why I'm doing the reading and not you.\n\n3\n00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,800\nI'll give you a hint. As old as I am, I still need practice,\n\n4\n00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,880\nbecause I learned to read quite early, around by the time I was four,\n\n5\n00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,260\nbut I didn't read out loud until I was fourteen because I didn't talk.\n\n6\n00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:40,800\nSee, I'm a stutterer and I'm also somewhat dyslexic, but we'll try this anyway.\n\n7\n00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:54,340\nToday I'm reading \"To Be A Drum\" written by Evelyn Coleman; the artwork is by Aminah Brenda Lynn Robinson.\n\n8\n00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:06,020\nDuring a morning mist, the fog swirled up around Mat, Martha, and their daddy.\n\n9\n00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:13,740\nAnd when they sat cross-legged, they couldn't be seen from afar. But they were there.\n\n10\n00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:25,760\nThen Daddy Wes told them a story in his soft voice, the voice that could tap, tap, tap Mat and Martha gently on their hearts.\n\n11\n00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,740\nDaddy Wes began.\n\n12\n00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:42,130\n\"Long before time, before hours and minutes and seconds, on the continent of Africa, the rhythm of the earth beat for the first people.\n\n13\n00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,260\nThe earth filled the air with spirit.\n\n14\n00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:57,720\nThe spirit rose on the wind and flew into our bodies. And our own hearts beat for the first time. We were alive!\n\n15\n00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,240\nThe beat moved through our bodies and pushed out from our fingers.\n\n16\n00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,880\nThat is how our drum was born.\n\n17\n00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,220\nWith the drum we spoke to the animals and to the people.\n\n18\n00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:23,260\nThe earth's heart beat out the rhythm of all there is. We listened-- and sounded the rhythms back for her to hear.\n\n19\n00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:30,919\nThen men from another continent came-- men who would not listen to the rhythm of the earth.\n\n20\n00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:42,349\nThey shackled us, the people of the earth's color, and flung us into the bellies of ships, bringing us enslaved across the oceans and the seas.\n\n21\n00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:48,269\nThey tore us apart from one another and did not allow us to speak our own languages.\n\n22\n00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:57,380\nWe were a lost people. We were no longer free. We thought we were no more.\n\n23\n00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,660\nThen they took the drums away.\n\n24\n00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,560\nBut cruelty cannot stop the earth's heart from beating.\n\n25\n00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:16,419\nThe earth's spirit moved through us still and pushed-- not only out our fingers, but out our entire bodies.\n\n26\n00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:24,819\nAnd we became the drums. Living drums-- beating for the whole world to hear and see.\n\n27\n00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,740\nWe were alive!  We would be free.\n\n28\n00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,340\nSo when we worked in the fields, we made our feet drums.\n\n29\n00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:43,460\nWhen we sang songs under starlit skies, we made our mouths drums.\n\n30\n00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:50,360\nWhen we talked to each other, we made our speech drums.\n\n31\n00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,460\nWhen we stitched our quilts, we made our hands drums.\n\n32\n00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,360\nWhen we fought in wars, we made our courage drums.\n\n33\n00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,580\nWhen we invented things, we made our minds drums.\n\n34\n00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:15,260\nWhen we fought for our freedom and for our civil rights, we made our communities drums.\n\n35\n00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:24,560\nWhen we created music, paintings, sculpture, dances, and dramas, we made our art drums.\n\n36\n00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,080\nWhen we wrote down our wisdom, we made our stories drums.\n\n37\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,940\nWhen we recorded our memories, we made our history drums.\n\n38\n00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:44,940\nWhen we became farmers, scientists, teachers, leaders, entrepreneurs, and tradespeople, we made our dreams drums.\n\n39\n00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:53,480\nWe were the earth's people. We were the living drums. We would always be free.\"\n\n40\n00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:02,180\nDaddy Wes leaned over and whispered, \"Listen, do you hear?\"\n\n41\n00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,919\nHe stretched out on the earth, his arms spread like a bird's wings.\n\n42\n00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,990\nMat and Martha lay down close beside and put their ears to the ground, too.\n\n43\n00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:26,309\nThey waited for the magic to be theirs. Waited for the hearing of the earth's heartbeat. Waited to become.\n\n44\n00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:29,560\n\"I hear it, Daddy Wes,\" said Martha.\n\n45\n00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,520\n\"I don't hear anything,\" said Mat.\n\n46\n00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,280\n\"You got to let go, son,\" Daddy Wes said. \"Be quiet and still.\n\n47\n00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,220\nYou'll grow to be strong if you learn to be still.\"\n\n48\n00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:55,320\nMat let out a deep sigh. His body relaxed like when he floated on the pond.\n\n49\n00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:06,100\nAt last he heard the earth's heartbeat. \"I hear it, Daddy Wes, I hear it too!\" he shouted.\n\n50\n00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,969\nDaddy Wes smiled. \"And what does the earth say?\"\n\n51\n00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:21,550\nMat and Martha and Daddy Wes all drummed the earth's heartbeat together, bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum.\n\n52\n00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:29,320\n\"Now the both of you,\" Daddy Wes said, \"will always know how to beat out your own rhythm on the earth.\n\n53\n00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:41,660\nThen Daddy Wes, Mat, and Martha took each other's hands and strolled from the field with the heartbeat of the earth sounding their way.\n\n54\n00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,289\nYou, too, can be free.\n\n55\n00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:47,380\nBecome a drum.",

00:06:08,389\nWhat a great story.\n144\n00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,550\nIt really got me at the end there.\n145\n00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,960\nI think that's definitely one of the things\nthat I love about reading.\n146\n00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:24,120\nThat you can really just get absorbed and\nlost and really put yourself in another person's shoes.\n147\n00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,509\nYou know, when ever a book does something\nlike that for me I think it's an extraordinary\n148\n00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,620\nand wonderful experience.\n149\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,870\nI'm grateful I got the opportunity to read\nand read it to you.\n",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,760\nHello, and welcome to the Screen Actors Guild Foundation BookPALS.\n\n2\n00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,980\nMy name is Sean Astin and I played Sam in \"Lord of the Rings.\"\n\n3\n00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:25,150\nI love to read, especially to kids. I have a daughter whose name is Allie and she loves it when I read to her, and we both love lima beans. Hmm.\n\n4\n00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:38,580\nThe story I'm going to read to you is called \"A Bad Case of Stripes,\" written and illustrated by David Shannon. Allie loves this book. I hope you do too.\n\n5\n00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:55,480\nCamilla Cream loved lima beans, but she never ate them. All of her friends hated lima beans and she wanted to fit in.\n\n6\n00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:04,240\nCamilla was always worried about what other people thought of her. Today she was fretting even more than usual.\n\n7\n00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,820\nIt was the first day of school and she couldn't decide what to wear. There were so many people to impress.\n\n8\n00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:22,190\nShe tried on forty-two outfits but none seemed quite right. She put on a pretty red dress and looked into the mirror.\n\n9\n00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:33,000\nAnd then she screamed. Her mother ran into the room, and she screamed too. \"Oh my heavens,\" she cried, \"You're completely covered with stripes!\"\n\n10\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,080\nThis was certainly true. Camilla was striped from head to toe. S he looked like a rainbow.\n\n11\n00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:48,760\nMrs. Cream felt Camilla's forehead.\n\"Do you feel alright?\" she asked.\n\"I feel fine,\" Camilla answered. \"But just look at me.\"\n\n12\n00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,260\n\"You get back in bed this instant!\" Her mother ordered. \"You're not going to school today!\"\n\n13\n00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:02,920\nCamilla was relieved. She didn't want to miss the first day of school, but she was afraid of what the other kids might say.\n\n14\n00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,880\nShe had no idea what to wear with those crazy stripes.\n\n15\n00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,440\nThat afternoon, Dr. Bumble came to examine Camilla. \"Most extraordinary!\" he exclaimed. \"I've never seen anything like it!\"\n\n16\n00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:28,340\n\"Are you having any coughing, sneezing, runny nose, aches, pains, chills, hot flashes, dizziness, drowsiness, shortness of breath, or uncontrollable twitching?\"\n\n17\n00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:39,720\n\"No,\" Camilla told him. \"I feel fine\".\n\"Well then,\" Dr. Bumble said, turning to Mrs. Cream. \"I don't see any reason why she shouldn't go to school tomorrow.\n\n18\n00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:50,969\nHere is some ointment that should help her clear up those stripes in a few days. If it doesn't, you know where to reach me.\" \nAnd off he went.\n\n19\n00:02:50,969 --> 00:03:02,609\nThe next day was a disaster. Everyone at school laughed at Camilla. They called her Camilla Crayon and Night of the Living Lollipop.\n\n20\n00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:15,280\nShe tried her best to act as if everything were normal. But when the class said the Pledge of Allegiance, her stripes turned red, white and blue, and she broke out in stars.\n\n21\n00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,400\nThe other kids thought this was great. One yelled out, \"Let's see some purple polka dots!\"\n\n22\n00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:30,160\nSure enough, Camilla turned all purple polka dots. Someone else shouted, \"Checkerboard!\" and a pattern of squares covered her skin.\n\n23\n00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:41,100\nSoon everyone was calling out different shapes and colors, and poor Camilla was changing faster than you can change channels on a TV.\n\n24\n00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:50,020\nThat night, Mr. Harms, the school principal, called.\n\"I'm sorry, Mrs. Cream,\" he said. \"I am going to have to ask you to keep Camilla home from school.\"\n\n25\n00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:58,760\nShe's just too much of a distraction, and I've been getting calls from the other parents. They're afraid those stripes may be contagious.\"\n\n26\n00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:08,880\nCamilla was so embarrassed. She couldn't believe that two days ago everyone liked her. Now, nobody wanted to be in the same room with her.\n\n27\n00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:17,000\nHer father tried to make her feel better.\n\"Is there anything I can get you, sweetheart?\" he asked.\n\n28\n00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:28,440\n\"No, thank you,\" sighed Camilla.\nWhat she really wanted was nice plate of lima beans, but she had been laughed at enough for one day.\n\n29\n00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:45,360\n\"Hmmm, well yes, I see,\" Dr. Bumble mumbled when Mr. Cream phoned the next day. \"I think I better bring in the specialists. We'll be right over.\"\n\n30\n00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,070\nAbout an hour later Dr. Bumble arrived with 4 people in long white coats.\n\n31\n00:04:50,070 --> 00:05:01,360\nHe introduced them to the Creams. \"This is Dr. Grop, Dr. Sponge, Dr. Cricket, and Dr. Young\".\nThen the specialists went to work on Camilla.\n\n32\n00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:11,860\nThey squeezed, jabbed, tapped, and tested. It was very uncomfortable.\n\"Well, it's not the mumps,\" concluded Dr. Grop.\n\n33\n00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:21,050\n\"Or the measles,\" said Dr. Sponge.\n\"Definitely not chicken pox,\" put in Dr. Cricket.\n\"Or sunburn,\" said Dr. Young.\n\n34\n00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,320\n\"Try these,\" said the specialists. They each handed her a bottle filled with different colored pills.\n\n35\n00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,620\n\"Take one of each before bed,\" said Dr. Grop.\nThen they filed out the front door, followed by Dr. Bumble.\n\n36\n00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:50,080\nThat night Camilla took her medicine. It was awful. When she woke up the next morning, she did feel different, but when she got dressed her clothes didn't fit right.\n\n37\n00:05:50,080 --> 00:06:03,040\nShe looked in the mirror and there staring back at her was a giant, multi-colored pill with her face on it.\n\n38\n00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:11,700\nDr. Bumble rushed over as soon as Mrs. Cream called, but this time instead of the specialists, he brought the experts.\n\n39\n00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:20,400\nDr. Gourd and Mr. Melon were the finest scientific minds in the land. Once again Camilla was poked and prodded, looked at and listened to.\n\n40\n00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,820\nThe experts wrote down lots of numbers and then they huddled together and whispered.\n\n41\n00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:36,020\nDr. Gourd finally spoke. \"It might be a virus,\" he announced with authority. Suddenly, funny little virus balls appeared all over Camilla.\n\n42\n00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,940\n\"Or possibly some form of bacteria,\" said Mr. Melon.\n\n43\n00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:52,040\nOut popped squiggly little bacteria tails.\n\"Or it could be a fungus,\" added Dr. Gourd. Instantly Camilla was covered with different colored fungus blotches.\n\n44\n00:06:52,040 --> 00:07:02,340\nThe experts looked at Camilla and then at each other. \"We need to go over the numbers again back at the lab,\" Dr. Gourd explained.\n\n45\n00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,180\n\"We'll call you when we know something.\" \nBut the experts didn't have a clue, much less a cure.\n\n46\n00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,240\nBy now the TV news had found out about Camilla.\n\n47\n00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,340\nReporters from every channel were outside her house telling the story of the bizarre case of the incredible changing kid.\n\n48\n00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,439\nSoon a huge crowd was camped out on the front lawn.\n\n49\n00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:33,020\nThe Creams were swamped with all kinds of remedies from psychologists, allergists, herbalists, nutritionists, psychics, an old medicine man,\n\n50\n00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,480\na guru and even a veterinarian.\n\n51\n00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,600\nEach so-called cure only added to poor Camilla's strange appearance, until it was hard to even recognize her.\n\n52\n00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:53,700\nShe sprouted roots and berries, crystals, feathers, and a long furry tail, but nothing worked.\n\n53\n00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:01,280\nOne day a woman who called herself an environmental therapist claimed she could cure Camilla.\n\n54\n00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:12,840\n\"Close your eyes,\" she said. \"Breathe deeply and become one with your room.\"\n\n55\n00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:23,360\n\"Oh, I wish you wouldn't have said that!\" Camilla groaned. Slowly she began to melt into the walls of her room.\n\n56\n00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:32,880\nHer bed became her mouth, her nose was a dresser, and two paintings were her eyes. The therapist screamed and ran from the house.\n\n57\n00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:42,860\n\"What are we going to do?\" cried Mrs. Cream.\n\"It just keeps getting worse and worse,\" she began to sob.\n\n58\n00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,920\nAt that moment Mr. Cream heard a quiet little knock at the front door.\n\n59\n00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,970\nHe opened it and there stood an old woman who was just as plump and sweet as a strawberry.\n\n60\n00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,260\n\"Uh, excuse me,\" she said brightly, \"but I think I can help.\"\n\n61\n00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,660\nShe went into Camilla's room and looked around.\n\"My goodness,\" she said with a shake of her head.\n\n62\n00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,000\n\"What we have here is a bad case of stripes, one of the worst I have ever seen.\"\n\n63\n00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,720\nShe pulled a container of small green beans from her bag. \"Here,\" she said, \"These might do the trick.\"\n\"Are those magic beans?\" asked Mrs. Cream.\n\n64\n00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:37,500\n\"Oh my, no,\" replied the kind old woman. \"There's no such thing. These are just plain old lima beans. I bet you'd like some, wouldn't you?\" she asked Camilla.\n\n65\n00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:52,120\nCamilla wanted a big heaping plate full of lima beans more than just about anything, but she was still afraid to admit it. \"Yuck,\" she said, \"no one likes lima beans, especially me.\"\n\n66\n00:09:52,120 --> 00:10:03,380\n\"Oh dear,\" the old woman said sadly. \"I guess I was wrong about you.\" She put the beans back in her bag and started toward the door.\n\n67\n00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,960\nCamilla watched the old woman walk away. Those beans would taste so good.\n\n68\n00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,480\nBeing laughed at for eating them was nothing compared to what she'd been going through.\n\n69\n00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:23,880\nShe finally couldn't stand it. \"Wait!\" she cried. \"The truth is that I really love lima beans.\"\n\n70\n00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:36,800\n\"I thought so,\" the old woman said with a smile. She took a handful of beans and popped them into Camilla's mouth.\n\n71\n00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,080\n\"Mmmm\" said Camilla. Suddenly the branches, feathers, and squiggly tails began to disappear,\n\n72\n00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:53,660\nthen the whole room swirled around. When it stopped, there stood Camilla, and everything was back to normal.\n\n73\n00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,590\n\"I'm cured!\" she shouted.\n\n74\n00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:08,960\n\"Yes,\" said the old woman. \"I knew the real you was in there somewhere.\"\nShe patted Camilla on the head, then she went outside and vanished into the crowd.\n\n75\n00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,380\nAfterward Camilla wasn't quite the same. Some of the kids at school said she was weird, but she didn't care a bit.\n\n76\n00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:24,530\nShe ate all the lima beans she wanted, and she never had even a touch of stripes again.\n\n77\n00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:34,620\nWell, pretty good right? I liked it, my daughter likes it, and we like lima beans.\n\n78\n00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:45,240\nSo I don't know about you, but if you can get a hold of some of these things... well, books, lima beans, whatever, I recommend it.",

together.\n\n196\n00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,040\n\"Peanut butter and jelly,\" said Carla, biting into her sandwich.\n\n197\n00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,880\n\"I like to be different.\"\n\n198\n00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,760\nThe end.\n\n199\n00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,460\nI picked \"Carla's Sandwich\" because\n\n200\n00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,120\nI like the idea of kids learning to celebrate their uniqueness.\n\n201\n00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,300\nThe things that make you you are you.\n\n202\n00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,280\nThere's no other person like you in the world\n\n203\n00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,820\nand that should be celebrated.\n\n204\n00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,160\nI think, at the end of the story, the kids learn to appreciate Carla's uniqueness\n\n205\n00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,820\nand I love that part of the story.\n\n206\n00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,620\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n207\n00:09:39,620 -->

I wondered which animals liked carrot cake.\n\n49\n00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,020\n“Where was the cake?” I asked.\n\n50\n00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,900\n“Right here, on the kitchen table.\n\n51\n00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,849\nI left it to cool and when I came back, there\nwas a big mess and no cake!”\n\n52\n00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,760\nMiss Rabbit sobbed.\n\n53\n00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,820\nThe captain handed her a hankie.\n\n54\n00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,820\n“Thank you,” sniffled Miss Rabbit.\n\n55\n00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,360\n“When did all this happen?” I asked.\n\n56\n00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,740\n“Probably between 8:00 and 10:00 this morning.”\n\n57\n00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,900\n“Any guess who might have done this?” I probed.\n\n58\n00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,100\nI noticed Miss Rabbit was wiping frosting\noff of her pajamas, whiskers, and nose.\n\n59\n00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,820\nShe clearly hadn’t had time\nfor her morning bath.\n\n60\n00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,640\n“No!” wailed Miss Rabbit.\n\n61\n00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,420\n“I don’t have a crumb of an idea!”\n\n62\n00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,080\nThe captain pointed to the window in the distance.\n\n63\n00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,920\nFowler the Owl was reading\nthe newspaper in her maple tree.\n\n64\n00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,640\nEveryone on the farm knew that Fowler liked\nrabbits.\n\n65\n00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,060\nShe liked them for breakfast.\n\n66\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,560\nShe liked them for lunch.\n\n67\n00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,640\nShe loved them for dinner.\n\n68\n00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,750\n“Does Fowler come around here?” I asked.\n\n69\n00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,030\n“No, she won’t mess with me.\n\n70\n00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,180\nI have a black belt in karate!” said Miss\nRabbit with a quick chop of her hind legs.\n\n71\n00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,020\n“And ma’am, whom did you invite to the\nparty?”\n\n72\n00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,020\n“Porcini and Hot Dog.\n\n73\n00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,900\nYou don’t think either of them is the thief,\ndo you?”\n\n74\n00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,580\n“Too soon to tell.”\n\n75\n00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,239\nI snapped shut the cover of my notepad.\n\n76\n00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,069\nThe captain checked the door.\n\n77\n00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,269\nI checked the windows.\n\n78\n00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,460\nThere was no sign of a break-in.\n\n79\n00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,080\nCould it be an inside job?\n\n80\n00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,760\n“Does anyone have a key to your rabbit hole?” I asked.\n\n81\n00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,860\nMiss Rabbit shook her head, sending crumbs\nand frosting flying.\n\n82\n00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,959\n“One last question. \nWhere were you when the cake was taken?”\n\n83\n00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,280\n“I was taking a quick catnap.”\n\n84\n00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,580\nHmm... a catnap.\n\n85\n00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,269\nSuch an odd thing for a bunny to do.\n\n86\n00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,030\nI taped off the crime scene.\n\n87\n00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,720\nThe captain dusted for prints and took photos.\n\n88\n00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,300\nThis case was going to be a hard nut to crack.\n\n89\n00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,760\nA hard nut indeed.\n\n90\n00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,840\nChapter 3: Suspects and Clues\n\n91\n00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,600\n11:00 am, Fowler’s Maple Tree\n\n92\n00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,220\nSuspect #1\n\n93\n00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,240\n“Hoo-hoo,” said Fowler, peeking her head\nout of her hole.\n\n94\n00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,300\n“What brings you two tasty treats to my\ntree?”\n\n95\n00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,699\n“Investigating a case,” I said, holding\nup my badge.\n\n96\n00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,040\n“Detective Wilcox and Captain Griswold,\nMFIs.\n\n97\n00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,940\nWhere were you between 8:00 and 10:00 this\nmorning?”\n\n98\n00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,520\n“I was chasing a field mouse.”\n\n99\n00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,500\n“Do you have any witnesses?”\n\n100\n00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,400\nIf someone had seen her, she’d have an alibi.\n\n101\n00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,620\n“There was one, but I ate him.”\n\n102\n00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,830\nThe captain shot her his\n“don’t-mess-with-this-mouse” look.\n\n103\n00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,060\nI shot her mine.\n\n104\n00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,840\n“You know it’s 30 years behind bars if\nyou eat an officer on this farm,” I warned.\n\n105\n00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,060\n“You don’t want to be a jailbird now,\ndo you?”\n\n106\n00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,460\n“Of course not!\n\n107\n00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,460\nBesides, I like my meals tender.\n\n108\n00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,740\nEveryone knows MFIs are too hardboiled to\nmake good eats.”\n\n109\n00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,610\nI chose to ignore that last comment.\n\n110\n00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,940\nThe captain glared at her with his\n“I’ll-show-you-who’s-hardboiled” look.\n\n111\n00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,780\n“Your tree faces Miss Rabbit’s hole.\n\n112\n00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,069\nHave you seen anyone come or go from \nMiss Rabbit’s in the last four hours?”\n\n113\n00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,680\n“Just Miss Rabbit and the two of you.\n\n114\n00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,140\nWhat’s this all about anyway?” asked Fowler.\n\n115\n00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,070\n“A cake,” I said.\n\n116\n00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,560\n“A rabbit cake?” asked Fowler.\n\n117\n00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,160\n“I love rabbit cake, especially with mouse\nfrosting.”\n\n118\n00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680\nI scowled. “No, a carrot cake.”\n\n119\n00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,860\n“I don’t know anything about a missing\ncarrot cake.”\n\n120\n00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,520\nFowler fluffed up her feathers, all innocent-like.\n\n121\n00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600\n“I didn’t say it was missing.”\n\n122\n00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,460\n“You wouldn’t be here if it were found,”\nsaid Fowler.\n\n123\n00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,479\n“Tell us what you know.”\n\n124\n00:06:25,480 --> 00:0The Case of the Missing Carrot Cake",

Please, I must try them on,” he said.\n\n17\n00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,760\nThe shoes fit perfectly. It was as if they had been made just for him.\n\n18\n00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,660\nHe was so pleased that he paid double the price.\n\n19\n00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,520\nNow the shoemaker had enough money to buy leather for two more pairs of shoes.\n\n20\n00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,940\nAgain that evening, the shoemaker cut out the leather for\nthe shoes and went to bed.\n\n21\n00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,000\nAnd once again, in the morning, there were the shoes—finished!\n\n22\n00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,220\nBuyers were not lacking for these either,\n\n23\n00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,660\nand as before, they were so pleased, they paid double the price.\n\n24\n00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,080\nNow the shoemaker had enough money to buy leather for four more pairs of shoes.\n\n25\n00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,160\nThe next morning, just as before, there were the shoes already made.\n\n26\n00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,620\nOn and on it went.\n\n27\n00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,260\nWhatever the shoemaker cut out in the evening was finished by morning.\n\n28\n00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,260\nSoon the news of the splendid shoes spread throughout the town,\n\n29\n00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,120\nand the shoemaker and his wife were no longer poor.\n\n30\n00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,680\nOne evening, not long before Christmas, as the shoemaker cut more leather for shoes, his wife spoke.\n\n31\n00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,360\n“Dear husband, who has made us so rich?\n\n32\n00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,040\nWhat if we were to stay up tonight and see who\ncomes to our shop?”\n\n33\n00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440\nThe shoemaker agreed.\n\n34\n00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,240\nSo that night they lit a small lamp in the hall, hid behind their coats and waited.\n\n35\n00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,800\nAs the clock struck midnight, they heard the creak of a window and the scuttle of small feet.\n\n36\n00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,560\nPeeking out from behind the coats,they saw two tiny children sneak into the workshop.\n\n37\n00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,380\nThey were poorly shod, and they wore only raggedy sacks for warmth.\n\n38\n00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,120\n“Elves!” the shoemaker’s wife whispered.\n\n39\n00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,500\nThe tiny elves tiptoed across the room and climbed up onto the table.\n\n40\n00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:22,120\nThen, humming and whistling, they began to stitch and\nsew and hammer so quickly with their little fingers\n\n41\n00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,500\nthat the shoemaker and his wife could not believe their eyes.\n\n42\n00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,060\nThe elves did not stop until all the shoes were finished and stood lined up on the table:\n\n43\n00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,380\nsturdy riding boots, delicate slippers,\nfeather-light dancing shoes and heavy clogs for work.\n\n44\n00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,740\nThen the elves tiptoed out of the workshop, up the stairs and out the window.\n\n45\n00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,060\nThe next morning the wife said, “The little elves have made us rich,\n\n46\n00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,940\nwe must give them something in return.\n\n47\n00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,020\nThey run around with so little on they must be freezing.\n\n48\n00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,900\nI will make a warm dress, coat and pants, and knit them each a pair of stockings.”\n\n49\n00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,780\n“And I shall be happy to make them each a pair of fine shoes,” said the shoemaker.\n\n50\n00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,360\nThey went right to work, and that evening they laid the presents on the worktable.\n\n51\n00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,820\nThen, like before, they hid behind the coats and waited.\n\n52\n00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,740\nAt midnight, the elves quietly slipped into the shop ready for another night’s work.\n\n53\n00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,940\nBut instead of pieces of leather, they found beautiful presents.\n\n54\n00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,860\nAt first they were too astonished to move.\n\n55\n00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,660\nThen they hugged their new warm clothes and quickly put them on.\n\n56\n00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,640\nWhen they were dressed, they leaped and bounced around the room, singing,\n\n57\n00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,200\n“Now we’re elves so fine to see,\nno longer cobblers we will be.”\n\n58\n00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500\nThey jumped over chairs, raced around the shop and finally ran out the door.\n\n59\n00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,120\nThe click and clack of their new shoes echoed through\nthe streets.\n\n60\n00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,460\nFrom that time on, the little elves were not seen again.\n\n61\n00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,380\nBut the shoemaker and his wife lived a long and happy life.\n\n62\n00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,580\nThe End.\n\n63\n00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,000\nSo I love this book because I think it is really important that we give and we receive\n\n64\n00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,500\nand I think as the elves gave so kindly to the shoemaker and his wife\n\n65\n00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,000\nto make sure that they lived a long and happy life they in turn gave\n\n66\n00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,380\nall the clothing to the elves and then the elves could go and help other people\n\n67\n00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,760\nand I think that it's really important to give with your whole heart.\n\n68\n00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,340\nThank you so much for watching Storyline Online\n\n69\n00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,320\nand make sure you watch all of our stories.\n\n70\n00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320\nKeep watching and keep reading!",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,500\nHi! Welcome to Storyline Online, brought\nto you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,340\nI'm Molly Ephraim and today we'll be reading Hanukkah in Alaska,\n\n3\n00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,460\nby Barbara Brown and Illustrated by Stacey Schuett.\n\n4\n00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,680\nI really love reading, but most of all, I like reading to other people,\n\n5\n00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,090\npeople younger than me. So maybe if you have\na little brother or a little sister or a little cousin,\n\n6\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,060\nor even a younger classmate, try reading\nto them. It's really fun.\n\n7\n00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,700\nIn Alaska, in winter, we have to watch out for moose.\n\n8\n00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,100\nWe have to look both ways when we go out the door, making sure there are no moose around.\n\n9\n00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,900\nThat's because moose are very big, and they\nkick things that surprise them or make them angry.\n\n10\n00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,300\nTheir big kicks are strong enough to dent a car.\n\n11\n00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,760\nMy mother drives slowly in the winter, looking out for moose.\n\n12\n00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,880\nWhen my friends and I are playing outside\n\n13\n00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,330\nand a moose comes along, we have to hug a tree.\n\n14\n00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,260\nA moose can't step on you or knock you over if you're hugging a tree.\n\n15\n00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,820\nAlso, during winter in Alaska, it's dark.\nNot just at night for sleeping, but almost all the time.\n\n16\n00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,860\nIt doesn't get light until it's already snack time at school,\n\n17\n00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,500\nand it's dark again practically\nright after lunch. Daytime is only five hours long.\n\n18\n00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:30,149\nAnd sometimes, when there's so much\nsnow that it covers up the windows,\n\n19\n00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,580\ndaylight  can barely peek in.\n\n20\n00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,200\nAlaska snow piles up everywhere.\n\n21\n00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,340\nIt gets so deep that the moose with their skinny legs have trouble walking in it.\n\n22\n00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,020\nThey like to use  people's shoveled driveways and paths.\n\n23\n00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,940\nThat's why a moose lives in our backyard.\n\n24\n00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,400\nHe wandered up our driveway, found a good spot where he could nibble at our trees, and decided to stay.\n\n25\n00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,760\nHe sleeps in our yard and eats our trees.\n\n26\n00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,730\nI try throwing carrots to him, even cookies,\nbut he really likes the tree with my blue swing on it.\n\n27\n00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,860\nI'm worried about my swing.\n\n28\n00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,090\nOnce, we saw a moose walking around town with\na swing in his antlers.\n\n29\n00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,160\nHe'd gotten tangled and just tore the whole\nswing away.\n\n30\n00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,140\nI think the dark and that moose are making\nme kind of grumpy,\n\n31\n00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,960\nbecause even Hanukkah hasn't cheered me up.\n\n32\n00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,900\nMy friends and I pretend to be dreidels spinning in the snow,\n\n33\n00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,000\nand when the mail lady comes, she always has another present for me from my aunts and uncles Outside.\n\n34\n00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,920\n(Do you know that everywhere else from Alaska is called \"Outside\"?)\n\n35\n00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,720\nBut every time I light a new candle in our menorah,\n\n36\n00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,050\nI look out the window and it's still\ndark, and that moose is still there, too close\n\n37\n00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,560\nto my swing and eating our trees.\nMy mother and I throw some apples, hoping\n\n38\n00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,180\nhe'll like them instead, but he just watches\nthem fall and eats more tree.\n\n39\n00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,140\nOne night as I am lighting the last Hanukkah\ncandle, my father says, \"Let's go outside.\n\n40\n00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,909\nI have something to show you.\"\n\"With the moose there?\"\n\n41\n00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:17,189\n\"Don't worry, we'll stay far away.\"\n\n42\n00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,840\nI put on my long underwear and two layers of socks.\n\n43\n00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,620\nI put on my thick, baggy pants...\n...and a sweatshirt. I put a snowsuit on over all that,\n\n44\n00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,240\ntwo layers of mittens, and a hat.\nStill, it's freezing cold outside, and it's very dark,\n\n45\n00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,110\nand I do not like being anywhere\nnear that moose.\n\n46\n00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,280\nI want that moose away from my swing!\n\n47\n00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,600\n\"Dad, what are we waiting for?\"\n\n48\n00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:53,420\n\"Just wait. You'll see.\" But he's looking\nat the sky. I'm looking at that moose.\n\n49\n00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,839\nMom says, \"Maybe we can try some fresh spinach.\nMaybe he'll leave your swing alone for something green.\"\n\n50\n00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,019\nBut the spinach doesn't work, and I'm freezing.\n\n51\n00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,540\nDad says, \"This is a perfect night. You'll see.\"\n\n52\n00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,190\nSuddenly, dad points up to the sky.\n\n53\n00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,440\nThere are pink and purple and orange ribbons of light!\n\n54\n00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,120\nThe sky is full of color, all swirling\nand shining and glowing.\n\n55\n00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,160\nAgainst the dark black of the sky, the lights\nare bright and beautiful.\n\n56\n00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,120\nI have never seen anything like this.\n\n57\n00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,080\nSo much light, and so big. Filling the sky,                coloring the sky.\n\n58\n00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,350\nA rainbow on black velvet.\n\n59\n00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,639\n\"They're called the northern lights,\" Dad says.\n\n60\n00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:49,540\n\"Aurora borealis. They happen especially up here in Alaska, but only when the sky is just right.\n\n61\n00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,300\nOur very own Hanukkah Festival of Lights.\"\n\n62\n00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,460\nIt looks like ribbons of wax,\n\n63\n00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,620\nall the candles from all the menorahs, melting into the dark, lighting it up.\n\n64\n00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,780\nI stare at those lights.\n\n65\n00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,220\nI stare so hard, I don't even notice the moose sticking his  head through my swing.\n\n66\n00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,500\nNext thing I know, the moose is yanking on the chain,\n\n67\n00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,820\npulling on the whole tree.\n\n68\n00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,700\nCREAK! CLANK! SNORT! <Audio swinging swing, cracking tree, snorting moose and bellow>\n\n69\n00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,550\nI can't stand it. That moose will tear everything up.\n\n70\n00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,759\nBut then I have an idea. I run into the house\nand run back outside with my hands full.\n\n71\n00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,340\nI wave what I have at the moose, and he sniffs,\nturning his head away from the swing.\n\n72\n00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,289\nI back up, laying what I have down in the\nsnow. The moose stretches his head, reaches for it.\n\n73\n00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,980\nI keep backing up, laying more down,\nand the moose follows me!\n\n74\n00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:54,200\nOut of the yard, down the driveway, AWAY! I lay the last batch down and race back into our yard.\n\n75\n00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:04,920\nI look at the sky, at the lights. I'm so happy\nto see those lights. I'm so happy that moose is gone.\n\n76\n00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,760\nMy parents are surprised. \"What did\nyou feed him?\" they ask. \"What did he like so much?\"\n\n77\n00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,919\n\"Latkes,\" I answer.\n\n78\n00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,000\nHanukkah can be pretty funny in Alaska,\n\n79\n00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,380\nand miracles can happen in a lot of different ways.\n\n80\n00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,480\nAnd that's the end.\n\n81\n00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,280\nIf you've never had latkes,\n\n82\n00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,389\nyou have to try them. They're pancakes, but\nthey're made out of potatoes.\n\n83\n00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,860\nBut make sure you have a grown-up to help you out because you have to use very hot oil.\n\n84\n00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,420\nMy dad makes them with zucchini, so they are a little healthier. They are really tasty.",

Brought to you\nby the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,070\nI'm Ed O'Neill and today I'll be reading How\nI Learned Geography written and illustrated\n\n3\n00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,630\nby Uri Shulevitz.\n\n4\n00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,660\nWhen war devastated the land,\n\n5\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,180\nbuildings crumbled to dust.\n\n6\n00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:31,260\nEverything we had was lost, and we fled empty-handed. We traveled far, far east to another country,\n\n7\n00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:39,290\nwhere summer were hot and winters were cold,\nto a city of houses made of clay, straw, and camel dung,\n\n8\n00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,120\nsurrounded by dusty steppes, burned\nby the sun.\n\n9\n00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,200\nWe lived in a small room with a couple we\ndid not know.\n\n10\n00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,359\nWe slept on a dirt floor.\n\n11\n00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,449\nI had no toys and no books.\n\n12\n00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,349\nWorst of all: food was scarce.\n\n13\n00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,580\nOne day, Father went to the bazaar to buy\nbread.\n\n14\n00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,659\nAs evening approached, he hadn't returned.\n\n15\n00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,689\nMother and I were worried and hungry.\n\n16\n00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,810\nIt was nearly dark when he came home.\n\n17\n00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,430\nHe carried a long roll of paper under his\narm.\n\n18\n00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,680\n\"I bought a map,\" he announced triumphantly.\n\n19\n00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,579\n\"Where is the bread?\"\n\n20\n00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:24,590\nMother asked.\n\n21\n00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,700\n\"I had enough money to buy only a tiny piece\nof bread, and we would still be hungry,\"\n\n22\n00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,890\nhe explained apologetically.\n\n23\n00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,200\n\"No supper tonight,\" Mother said bitterly.\n\n24\n00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,850\n\"We'll have the map instead.\"\n\n25\n00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,570\nI was furious.\n\n26\n00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,120\nI didn't think I would ever forgive him, and\nI went to bed hungry, while the couple we\n\n27\n00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,030\nlived with ate their meager supper.\n\n28\n00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,360\nThe husband was a writer.\n\n29\n00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,420\nHe write in silence, but, oh!\n\n30\n00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,740\nhow loudly he\nchewed.\n\n31\n00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,619\nHe chewed a small crust of bread as if it\nwere the most delicious morsel in the world.\n\n32\n00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,220\nI envied him his bread and wished I were the\none chew it.\n\n33\n00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:10,300\nI covered my head with my blanket so I would\nnot hear him smacking his lips with such noisy delight.\n\n34\n00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,590\nThe next day father hung the map.\n\n35\n00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,760\nIt took up an entire wall.\n\n36\n00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160\nOur cheerless room was flooded with color.\n\n37\n00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,010\nI became fascinated by the map and spent long\nhours looking at it, studying its every detail,\n\n38\n00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,290\nand many days drawing it on any scrap of paper\nthat chanced my way.\n\n39\n00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,770\nI found strange-sounding names on the map\nand savored their exotic sounds,\n\n40\n00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:42,659\nmaking a little rhyme out of them: Fukuoka Takaoka\nomsk, Fukuyama Nagayama Tomsk, Okazaki Miyazaki\n\n41\n00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,060\nPinks, Pennsylvania Transylvania Minsk!\n\n42\n00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,660\nI repeated this rhyme like a magic incantation\nand was transported far away\n\n43\n00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,560\nwithout ever leaving our room.\n\n44\n00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,360\nI landed in burning deserts.\n\n45\n00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,349\nI ran on beaches and felt their sand between\nmy toes.\n\n46\n00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,650\nI Climbed snowy mountains where icy winds\nlicked my face.\n\n47\n00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,810\nI saw wondrous temples where stone carving\ndanced on the walls,\n\n48\n00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,159\nand birds of all colors sang on the rooftops.\n\n49\n00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,690\nI pass through fruit groves eating as many\npapayas and mangos as I pleased.\n\n50\n00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,050\nI drank fresh water and rested in the shade\nof palm trees.\n\n51\n00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:32,490\nI cam to a city of tall buildings and counted\nzillions of windows, falling asleep before I could finish.\n\n52\n00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:40,190\nAnd so I spent enchanted hours far, far from\nour hunger and misery.\n\n53\n00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,680\nI forgave my father.\n\n54\n00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,720\nHe was right, after all.\n\n55\n00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,760\nYou know, I like this story because it took\nthe boy out of his desprate situation to other\n\n56\n00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,720\nworlds that he enjoyed so much more.\n\n57\n00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,019\nIt reminds me of when I was a boy of twelve.\n\n58\n00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:05,980\nI discovered an author by the name of Mark\nTwain and the name of the book was Huckleberry\n\n59\n00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,570\nFinn and it took me down the Mississippi River\nand lots of adventures that I wouldn't normally\n\n60\n00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,110\nhave had in Youngstown Ohio.\n\n61\n00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,880\nReading can do that for you.\n\n62\n00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,980\nIt can take you to other worlds, other places,\n\n63\n00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,500\nother experiences that you would never normally have.\n\n64\n00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,550\nThank you

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,180\nWelcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,780\nI'm Oprah Winfrey, and today I'm going to be reading \"The Hula-Hoopin' Queen\"\n\n3\n00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:19,260\nwritten by Thelma Lynne Godin and illustrated by Vanessa Brantley-Newton.\n\n4\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,780\nToday is the day I'm gonna beat Jamara Johnson at hooping.\n\n5\n00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,120\nThen I'll be the Hula-Hoopin' queen of 139th street!\n\n6\n00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,680\nJamara says she's gonna be the queen forever, but last week I almost beat her.\n\n7\n00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:44,000\nI sort through my hoops and pick out my favorite. And then I feel it comin' on. The itch. The Hula-Hoopin' itch.\n\n8\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,380\nMy fingers start snappin', and my feet start tappin'. My hips start swingin',\n\n9\n00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,720\nand I'm just reachin' for a hoop when Mama says...\n\n10\n00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,940\n\"Girl, don't you even think about it. You know today is Miz Adeline's birthday.\"\n\n11\n00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,940\nHeat washes up over me, and I stamp my foot. Don't get me wrong. I love Miz Adeline.\n\n12\n00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,940\nShe lives right next door. Miz Adeline took care of Mama when she was little, and she took care of me too.\n\n13\n00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,800\nShe's like my very own grandmama.\n\n14\n00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:30,260\n\"But, Mama,\" I burst out. \"I can't help with Miz Adeline's party. I'm supposed to meet Jamara. Today's the day...\"\n\n15\n00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:39,080\nMama stands as still as water in a puddle. She gives me her look. Then she hands me a broom.\n\n16\n00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,960\nI sigh loudly and start sweeping.\n\n17\n00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,940\nBut when Mama's not watching, I push my favorite hoop a little closer to the door with my toe.\n\n18\n00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,840\nMama and I dust every room and scrub down the floors.\n\n19\n00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,460\nWe polish each window 'til we can see clear to New Jersey.\n\n20\n00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,860\nAfter that I peel potatoes while Mama starts mixing up her special double-fudge chocolate cake.\n\n21\n00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:14,540\n\"Kameeka, set the oven to 350 degrees,\" Mama says as she empties the last of the sugar into the mixing bowl.\n\n22\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,400\n\"And add sugar to the grocery list.\"\n\n23\n00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,740\nI push the button on the oven and look out the window. It's already getting late.\n\n24\n00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,640\nI bet Jamara's telling everybody I'm too scared to hoop her.\n\n25\n00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,400\nWhile the cake bakes, we make up plates of fancy sandwiches.\n\n26\n00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,000\nThen Mama slices strawberries and shows me how to make whipped cream.\n\n27\n00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,200\nWhen the timer rings, Mama opens the oven.\n\n28\n00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,080\n\"Kameeka!\" Mama yells as she checks the oven temperature. \"You only set it to 250 degrees!\"\n\n29\n00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,100\nMiz Adeline's birthday cake looks like someone sat on it. Mama says we'll have to start over.\n\n30\n00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,580\nMama sends me to the store to buy more sugar.\n\n31\n00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:08,140\nOn my way out the door, I grab a hoop like I usually do, but when I get outside, I remember that I'm on a mission.\n\n32\n00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,740\nMiz Adeline's party will be starting in a couple of hours.\n\n33\n00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,500\nMama has to finish the potato salad, and we still have to make another cake.\n\n34\n00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,420\nI don't even twirl my hoop as I hurry down the street.\n\n35\n00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,100\nI don't stop to blow kisses to Miss Evelyn or wave to Mr. John in the bakery.\n\n36\n00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:36,500\nI'm coming out of the store when I see Jamara and Portia hoopin' on the corner of 139th and Broadway.\n\n37\n00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,800\n\"We thought you weren't coming, Kameeka,\" says Jamara with a smirk.\n\n38\n00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,160\nI need to get the sugar back to Mama, but Jamara sounds so smug I can't stand it.\n\n39\n00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,900\n\"Well, you thought wrong,\" I tell her.\n\"You ready?\" she asks.\n\n40\n00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280\n\"I was born ready.\"\n\n41\n00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,900\nAnd then I feel it comin' on. The itch. The Hula-Hoopin' itch.\n\n42\n00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,300\n\"Whoever hoops the longest is the winner,\" Portia says.\n\n43\n00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,700\nAs soon as she shouts \"Go!\" my fingers start snappin' and my feet start tappin'.\n\n44\n00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,340\nMy hips start swingin', and I just know I'm gonna beat Jamara today.\n\n45\n00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,440\nNeighborhood kids crowd around as Jamara and I hoop. Cars honk and slow down.\n\n46\n00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,980\nTrucks roar past, throwing up heat and dust from the pavement. Swish, swiggle, swish.\n\n47\n00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,600\nJamara frowns. \"You've been practicing some,\" she says.\n\n48\n00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,800\n\"That's right, girl.\" A grin greater than the Brooklyn Bridge stretches across my face.\n\n49\n00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:49,800\nThe sun moves between the buildings, and the sidewalk starts cooling down, but Jamara and me keep on hoopin'.\n\n50\n00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,020\n\"I've got doughnuts for Miz Adeline's party,\" Mr. John calls out as he closes up the bakery.\n\n51\n00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,360\nSwish, swiggle, swish, swiggle.\n\n52\n00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,040\n\"Miz Adeline's cake!\" I shout.\n\n53\n00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,640\nMy hoop clatters to the sidewalk. I grab it and the sugar, and race up the block.\n\n54\n00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,440\nI can hear Jamara laughing behind me.\n\n55\n00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:18,660\nBy the time I reach our apartment, Mama is madder than a hornet. \"Kameeka Hayes!\" she scolds.\n\n56\n00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,580\n\"I'm sorry, Mama. I saw Jamara and--\"\n\n57\n00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:31,260\n\"Girl, I don't want to hear that Hula-Hoopin' nonsense. It's too late now. Miz Adeline's already here.\n\n58\n00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,540\nYou take yourself on into the living room and explain to Miz Adeline why she won't have cake for her birthday.\"\n\n59\n00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,840\nMiz Adeline brought her own music, and she's got it turned up loud.\n\n60\n00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:53,760\nShe's sitting and listening to a jazzy blues tune, noddin' her head like a spring robin looking for a worm.\n\n61\n00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:01,880\n\"Hi, Miz Adeline,\" I say. \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\"Kameeka, come here, baby. Give me a kiss.\"\n\n62\n00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,780\nI come in close and kiss Miz Adeline's soft cheek.\n\n63\n00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,640\nThen I whisper in her ear, \"You don't really like cake much, do you?\"\n\n64\n00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:24,320\n\"Baby girl, you know I sure do love cake. Chocolate cake with strawberries and real whipped cream on top.\"\n\n65\n00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,420\nShe pats my arm. \"Oh yes, that is my favorite cake.\" Miz Adeline smiles at me.\n\n66\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,400\nI try to smile back, but my heart is racing as fast as the roller coaster at Coney Island.\n\n67\n00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,860\nI can't tell her about the cake just yet.\n\n68\n00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,200\nPretty soon the neighbors start arriving.\n\n69\n00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:51,740\nMiss Evelyn's wearing her Sunday church hat, and Mr. John's all spruced up in a pin-striped suit.\n\n70\n00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,140\nJamara and Portia sashay in with their parents. They're still carrying their hoops from earlier today.\n\n71\n00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:05,640\n\"Girls, I don't want to see any hoops,\" says Mama firmly to Jamara and Portia. \"Okay, Mrs. Hayes,\" says Jamara.\n\n72\n00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:12,760\nShe flashes her big, smirking smile at me. \"Kameeka, you're about done with hoopin' after today, aren't you?\"\n\n73\n00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,320\nI smile right back at her. \"Don't you bet on it, Jamara.\"\n\n74\n00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:26,980\nMost of the presents are still unopened when Miz Adeline says, \"Well, I do believe it's time for birthday cake.\"\n\n75\n00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,860\nI swallow hard.\n\n76\n00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:42,200\n\"Miz Adeline,\" I say slowly. \"We made a cake, but it didn't turn out right.\n\n77\n00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:50,540\nThen we needed more sugar to make another one, but I didn't get the sugar back to Mama in time 'cause I was hoopin'.\n\n78\n00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,620\nI was trying to beat Jamara so I could be the Hula-Hoopin' Queen of 139th Street.\n\n79\n00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,920\nIt's my fault there isn't any cake.\n\n80\n00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,920\n\"No cake?\" says Miz Adeline, raising her eyebrows.\n\n81\n00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,320\nI look over at Jamara. She's spinning one of Mr. John's doughnuts round and round on her finger like it's a Hula-Hoop.\n\n82\n00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,100\nSuddenly that gives me an idea.\n\n83\n00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,980\n\"I'll be right back,\" I yell as I race from the room.\n\n84\n00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:29,240\nIn the kitchen I set a chocolate doughnut on a pretty plate. I add whipped cream and strawberries.\n\n85\n00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,280\nMama comes in to help. I put a candle on top, and she lights it.\n\n86\n00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:46,840\nAs I carry the doughnut cake to Miz Adeline, Mama starts singing \"Happy Birthday,\" and everyone joins in.\n\n87\n00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,740\nThe candle glows as bright as the smile on Miz Adeline's face.\n\n88\n00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,820\n\"Why, this is just about perfect,\" Miz Adeline says, taking a bite of her doughnut birthday cake.\n\n89\n00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:06,300\n\"Now, Kameeka, did you say you were hoopin'? When I was a girl, I was the best Hula-Hooper on this block.\"\n\n90\n00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:16,160\n\"Adeline, don't you start that nonsense,\" Miss Evelyn says as she marches on over to us. \"You know very well I was the best.\"\n\n91\n00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:27,660\nMiz Adeline looks at me. \"Baby girl, why don't you bring some hoops on in here and let me show this old girl what she forgot.\"\n\n92\n00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,120\nMy eyes find Mama's. She shakes her head.\n\n93\n00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,900\nBut Miz Adeline's already pushing back chairs to make room. Then she slips a hoop over her head.\n\n94\n00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,240\nAnd right then I know.\n\n95\n00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,480\nMiz Adeline's just like me. She's got the itch. The Hula-Hoopin' itch.\n\n96\n00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,820\nHer fingers start snappin', and her feet start tappin.'\n\n97\n00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:00,760\nHer hips start swingin', and before we know it that hoop is swishin' right around Miz Adeline's waist.\n\n98\n00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,880\nThen she's got it swingin' around her neck.\n\n99\n00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,420\nI glance over at Mama and see a smile pulling at her lips in spite of herself.\n\n100\n00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,140\nMiz Adeline shimmies the hoop down past her knees.\n\n101\n00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,440\nShe spins it around her ankle as she hops on one foot, then the other.\n\n102\n00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,640\nWith the hoop still swishin' round and round, Miz Adeline heads for the door.\n\n103\n00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,640\nMiss Evelyn grabs one of my hoops, and Mr. John grabs another.\n\n104\n00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,580\nEven Mama's hips are swingin' as the whole party spills out on to the street.\n\n105\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,440\nEverybody's got the itch. The Hula-Hoopin' itch.\n\n106\n00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,980\nPretty soon hoops are swishin' and swingin' all the way down the block.\n\n107\n00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:02,420\n\"Kameeka, this is the best birthday party I've ever had!\" Miz Adeline hollers.\n\n108\n00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:11,080\nJamara hoops on over to me. \"Kameeka,\" she says. \"I know who the real Hula-Hoopin' Queen of 139th Street is.\"\n\n109\n00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,300\n\"I do too,\" I say.\n\n110\n00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,000\nJamara settles her hoop around her waist. \"You ready, Kameeka?\"\n\n111\n00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,940\n\"I was born ready,\" I say.\n\n112\n00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:30,620\nThe sidewalk is cooler than a spring rain, and the streetlights shine like stars.\n\n113\n00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,960\nSwish, swiggle, swish...\n\n114\n00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,360\nThe end.\n\n115\n00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,100\nWell, the reason I wanted to read this story to you all is because I love Hula Hoops so much,\n\n116\n00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:53,060\nand it was one of my favorite things to play with when I was a girl. And even now, as a full-grown adult,\n\n117\n00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,180\nI have my own Hula Hoop, I have actually several Hula Hoops,\n\n118\n00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,920\nand I have an emoji that is an avatar of myself with a Hula Hoop.\n\n119\n00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:10,860\nAnd whenever anything fun, or special, or really fantastic happens in my life,\n\n120\n00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:18,100\nI go out and I get my Hula Hoops and I swish, swiggle, swish.\n\n121\n00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,180\nThanks for watching Storyline Online.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,600\nWelcome to Storyline Online.\n\n2\n00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,480\nBrought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n3\n00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,840\nI'm Lonnie Chavis.\n\n4\n00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,560\nI'm Mackenzie Hancsicsak.\n\n5\n00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,200\nAnd I'm Parker Bates.\n\n6\n00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,600\nAnd today, we are going to read\n\"If I Ran for President\"\n\n7\n00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,680\nwritten by Catherine Stier and illustrated\nby Lynne Avril Cravath.\n\n8\n00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,680\nIt would be great to run for president of\nthe United States!\n\n9\n00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,000\nIf I ran for president, \nI’d hope the people of the United States\n\n10\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,179\nwould choose me for a very important job—\nthe job of leading our country.\n\n11\n00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,240\nAnd I’d hope to follow in the footsteps\nof past presidents such as:\n\n12\n00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,520\nGeorge Washington, our first president,\n\n13\n00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,620\nThomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt,\nand Abraham Lincoln.\n\n14\n00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,940\nI’d have to think carefully about my decision\nto run for president.\n\n15\n00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,250\nI would want to know how my family felt about\nit, too.\n\n16\n00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,100\nThen I’d ask myself: “Am I the best person\nfor the job?\n\n17\n00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,960\nAm I ready to work \nVERY, VERY, VERY hard for my country?\n\n18\n00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,860\nDo lots of people\nbelieve in me, and will they help me run for office?”\n\n19\n00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,420\nIf I could answer yes to all those questions,\nthen I’d declare my candidacy.\n\n20\n00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,620\nThat means I’d announce I was interested\nin the job of president of the United States.\n\n21\n00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,860\nIf I ran for president, I’d run a campaign\nto let voters learn all about me.\n\n22\n00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,160\nPeople who thought I would be a good president\nwould donate money or time to help.\n\n23\n00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,200\nI’d hire people to work on my campaign, too.\n\n24\n00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,800\nCampaigns can make a candidate famous!\n\n25\n00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,080\nSoon my name or face would\nappear on signs,\n\n26\n00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,220\nbuttons, bumper stickers, and T-shirts!\n\n27\n00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,700\nI’d even star in television commercials.\n\n28\n00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,340\nIf I ran for president, \nI’d work with my political party—\n\n29\n00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,520\nthat’s a group of people who share the same beliefs\nabout how the country should be governed.\n\n30\n00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,180\nThey support candidates who\nuphold those ideas.\n\n31\n00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,640\nThe two major parties are the Democratic party\n(their symbol is a donkey)\n\n32\n00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,540\nand the Republican party \n(their symbol is an elephant).\n\n33\n00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,180\nThere are other parties, too, called “third\nparties.”\n\n34\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,020\nBut people besides me would want to be president.\n\n35\n00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,460\nThe Republican and Democratic parties must choose whom they’ll support in the election.\n\n36\n00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,640\nIn some states, like Iowa, the parties\neach hold meetings called caucuses (KAW-kuhs-uhs),\n\n37\n00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,200\nwhere members pick their favorite candidate.\n\n38\n00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,960\nIn most states, party members\nhold an election called a primary.\n\n39\n00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,380\nCaucuses and primaries show which candidates are popular with voters\n\n40\n00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,560\nand who might have the best chance\nof being elected president.\n\n41\n00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,300\nThe first primary is held in New Hampshire,\nin the winter before the presidential election.\n\n42\n00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,420\nI’d be sure to visit there—\nbut I’d have to bundle up!\n\n43\n00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,560\nIn the summer before the election, the political parties announce their candidate for president.\n\n44\n00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,360\nThe major parties make this announcement\nat meetings called conventions.\n\n45\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,580\nEach state sends delegates to the convention.\n\n46\n00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,000\nDelegates vote for the candidate who was most popular in their state.\n\n47\n00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,400\nA convention looks like a big celebration,\nfull of cheering and chanting, balloons and confetti.\n\n48\n00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,180\nMillions of Americans watch the excitement on TV.\n\n49\n00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,280\nBy the time of the convention, everyone usually knows which candidate will be chosen,\n\n50\n00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,400\nbut the delegates still hold a vote.\n\n51\n00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,560\nIf my party chose me to run for president,\n\n52\n00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,800\nI’d make a speech to get \neveryone excited about helping me win.\n\n53\n00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,560\nI’d tell the American people about my platform— \nmy plans and ideas for our country.\n\n54\n00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,880\nMy running mate would make a speech, too.\n\n55\n00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,460\nThat’s the person who’d be my\nvice-president if I became president.\n\n56\n00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,660\nIf I ran for president, I’d be invited to\ndebate with other presidential candidates.\n\n57\n00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,100\nA person called a moderator would ask us questions.\n\n58\n00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,220\nPeople across the country would listen \ncarefully to our answers.\n\n59\n00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,980\nReporters would ask me questions, too, \nabout my life, my family—\n\n60\n00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,180\neven my kitten, Sassy.\n\n61\n00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,820\nThey’d print old photographs of me in newspapers and magazines,\n\n62\n00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,040\nlike the snapshot of me in my superhero costume,\n\n63\n00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,820\nor my baby picture when I still wore diapers!\n\n64\n00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,140\nIf I ran for president, I would travel the\ncountry to meet lots of people.\n\n65\n00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,260\nI’d have my own campaign bus or airplane\nto take me from place to place.\n\n66\n00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,460\nInside there’d be comfy seats, perfect for\nchecking out the news,\n\n67\n00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,780\nwriting speeches, and thinking about how to solve the nation’s problems.\n\n68\n00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,560\nI’d take naps, too— I’d need the extra rest!\n\n69\n00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,480\nI’d work hard and be very busy!\n\n70\n00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,820\nAll in one week, I might share cereal\nwith kindergartners in California,\n\n71\n00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,300\ncrunch corn with farmers in Kansas,\n\n72\n00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,820\n...and have dinner in Delaware,\n\n73\n00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,740\nwhere I’d order the Blue Plate Special \nwith apple pie and a large strawberry milkshake.\n\n74\n00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,160\nAfter all that food, I might not feel too well!\n\n75\n00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,540\nStill, I’d have to smile and talk with the people I met.\n\n76\n00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,080\nPresidential candidates make lots of speeches, shake hands— and cuddle babies.\n\n77\n00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,300\nFinally, in November, Election Day would arrive.\n\n78\n00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,040\nIf I ran for president,\nI’d be nervous and excited!\n\n79\n00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,020\nOn Election Day, millions of voters from across the country go to their polling places to “cast their ballots.”\n\n80\n00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,880\nThat’s another way to say that they vote.\n\n81\n00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,500\nIn our country, people vote in private.\n\n82\n00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,340\nNo one but you knows how you voted,\n\n83\n00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,100\nbut I know I’d choose my favorite candidate— me!\n\n84\n00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,520\nOnce the voting is finished, officials count\nup the ballots.\n\n85\n00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,260\nThen comes the announcement on television, radio, in the newspapers, and on the Internet.\n\n86\n00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,100\nPeople everywhere find out\nwho will be the next president of the United States.\n\n87\n00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,380\nI’d stay up late and keep my fingers crossed.\n\n88\n00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240\nIf I ran for president and lost,\n\n89\n00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,540\nthe people who worked so hard on my campaign would be disappointed.\n\n90\n00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160\nI’d be disappointed, too!\n\n91\n00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,580\nStill, I’d be proud that I had taken part in a free and fair election.\n\n92\n00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,240\nI’d make a telephone call to offer my best wishes and my support to the winner—\n\n93\n00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,520\nour next president!\n\n94\n00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,280\nBut if I won... WOW!\n\n95\n00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,280\nOn January 20th, I’d say the words of the\noath of office and be sworn in as president.\n\n96\n00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,840\nOn that day, my Inauguration Day, \nthere’d be a parade and a fancy ball!\n\n97\n00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400\nThen I’d move into the White House in Washington, D.C., to begin my four-year term\n\n98\n00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,200\nas the president of the United States of America.\n\n99\n00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,340\nAnd what would I do when I became president?\n\n100\n00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,120\nWell, that’s another story.\n\n101\n00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,400\nThe end!\n\n102\n00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,440\nI learned a lot from this book.\n\n103\n00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,920\nIt's not just about running for president,\nit's also about being a good citizen and voting.\n\n104\n00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,700\nYeah, I can't wait to turn eighteen to vote.\n\n105\n00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,460\nI'm going to register to vote when I'm seventeen\nso I'm ready to go.\n\n106\n00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,060\nIt's up to us to elect people who will represent\nus the best.\n\n107\n00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,640\nYeah, voting is super important.\n\n108\n00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100\nI go with my mom to the polls when she votes.\n\n109\n00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,540\nIt's a lot of fun too.\n\n110\n00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,760\nAnd as kids we have to remember we have a voice too.\n\n111\n00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,500\nEven though we can't vote yet we can still\nuse our voice to make change.\n\n112\n00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,640\nThat's true.\n\n113\n00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,120\nHey, thank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n114\n00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,280\nMake sure you check out all of our stories.\n\n115\n00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,960\nKeep watching and keep reading!",

to\nread Lotus and Feather,\n\n3\n00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,220\nwritten by Ji-li Jiang, and illustrated by\nJulie Downing.\n\n4\n00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,580\nLotus walked home from school by herself yet again.\n\n5\n00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,080\nThese days no one invited her to play.\n\n6\n00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:39,460\nEver since a winter illness had taken her voice, the other kids treated her like a strange creature.\n\n7\n00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:47,380\nLotus lived with her grandfather, a craftsman who made beautiful baskets out of reeds.\n\n8\n00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,580\nGrandpa understood Lotus's loneliness.\n\n9\n00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:58,220\nHe stroked her hair and invited her to go\nboating with him on the nearby lake.\n\n10\n00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,140\n\"This lake used to be so alive,\" Grandpa\nsaid.\n\n11\n00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:10,050\n\"Lotus flowers swayed in the breeze, fish\njumped into the boat, birds sang in the sky,\n\n12\n00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,820\nand foxes watched from the shore.\n\n13\n00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,380\nBut now\"—he looked around the deserted\nlandscape and sighed—\n\n14\n00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,540\n\"it has been ruined by greedy fishermen and hunters,\n\n15\n00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,340\nand by ignorant people who took over land where animals once lived.\"\n\n16\n00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,140\nLotus blew a whistle made out of a reed.\n\n17\n00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,880\nThe sound drifted around the empty lake like a wisp of sorrow.\n\n18\n00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,840\nOne morning, Lotus went to collect reeds for Grandpa.\n\n19\n00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:55,460\nShe stopped in awe when she saw a big bird, as white as fresh snow, standing in the marsh grass.\n\n20\n00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,360\nIts wide wings were edged with black feathers, like lace on a dress.\n\n21\n00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,960\nAbove the long, curved neck, its head was crowned with a red top like a dazzling ruby.\n\n22\n00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,360\nA crane!\n\n23\n00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,680\nLotus shouted silently.\n\n24\n00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,240\nShe had heard many stories about the endangered cranes from Grandpa, but she had never seen one.\n\n25\n00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,280\nThey had stopped coming because the wetland\nwas disappearing.\n\n26\n00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,840\nBLAM!\n\n27\n00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920\nA loud gunshot startled her.\n\n28\n00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,300\nLotus turned around and saw a man with a hat made out of reeds aiming his barrel straight at the bird!\n\n29\n00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,880\nLotus couldn't utter any sound, but she crouched down and drummed her metal pail with her reed cutter,\n\n30\n00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,499\nmaking a noise like thunder.\n\n31\n00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,420\nThe hunter fled, dropping his hat and never looking back.\n\n32\n00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,240\nLotus hurriedly waded across the wetland toward the bird.\n\n33\n00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,540\nWhen the crane spotted her, it tried to run\nbut collapsed instead.\n\n34\n00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,120\nLotus gathered up the heavy bird.\n\n35\n00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,580\nHold on.\n\n36\n00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,440\nHold on, please, she pleaded silently.\n\n37\n00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,020\nShe tottered home to Grandpa, who had rescued other animals before.\n\n38\n00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,620\nCarefully, Grandpa wrapped the bird's wound.\n\n39\n00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,320\n\"He's lost a lot of blood, but he will survive,\" he said.\n\n40\n00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,660\nLotus trusted Grandpa, but still she was worried.\n\n41\n00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:34,740\nThe crane barely moved and didn't open his\neyes, not even when Grandpa fed him rice soup.\n\n42\n00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:42,280\nLotus tucked the bird into the soft nest she had made for him and gently stroked him,\n\n43\n00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,200\njust like Grandpa used to do when she was sick.\n\n44\n00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,400\nFor two days Lotus watched the bird anxiously and hardly slept.\n\n45\n00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,320\nOn the third day, she fell asleep by the nest.\n\n46\n00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,380\nShe awoke when she felt the air stir.\n\n47\n00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,439\nThe crane lifted his head for the first time and looked straight at her.\n\n48\n00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,480\nGingerly, Lotus put her small fingers on his head.\n\n49\n00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,320\nThe bird stretched his neck, and rubbed her cheek gently.\n\n50\n00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,560\nLotus's heart pounded, and tears sprang to\nher eyes.\n\n51\n00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,640\n\"Feather\" was the name Lotus chose for her new friend.\n\n52\n00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,740\nWhen she helped wash his wound, Feather stared at her.\n\n53\n00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,480\nWhen she whistled with her reed, Feather rubbed her cheek with his head.\n\n54\n00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,920\nFilled with happiness, Lotus searched the\nrocks and climbed trees to find food for him.\n\n55\n00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,340\nAt night she often stroked him until he fell into sleep.\n\n56\n00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,500\nOne day, slowly and cautiously, Feather took his first step.\n\n57\n00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,140\nLotus jumped and swirled and hugged Grandpa blissfully.\n\n58\n00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,840\nSoon Feather was following Lotus everywhere.\n\n59\n00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,140\nHer reed whistle, like a magic wand, made him move up, down, slow, and fast.\n\n60\n00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:20,420\nLotus loved her new friend so much that she didn't want to leave him for school.\n\n61\n00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,840\nGrandpa shook his head firmly.\n\n62\n00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:31,040\nFeather, as if he understood what was happening, pushed her outside with his long neck.\n\n63\n00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,700\nThen he followed her all the way to school.\n\n64\n00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,140\nFeather waited outside Lotus's classroom.\n\n65\n00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,580\nAs soon as school was over, Lotus blew her whistle, and here Feather came.\n\n66\n00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,820\nWhen Lotus whistled short notes, Feather pranced on his long, thin, legs in rhythm.\n\n67\n00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,820\nWhen Lotus whistled long notes, he dipped his neck and opened his wings wide.\n\n68\n00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,060\nHe could not yet fly, but he could dance!\n\n69\n00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,580\nThe astonished kids clapped and cheered.\n\n70\n00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,400\nThey all joined in, dancing in a circle.\n\n71\n00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400\nLotus's heart swelled with pride.\n\n72\n00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,840\nShe blew her whistle long and high, like the\nmelody at the Chinese New Year celebration.\n\n73\n00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,760\nFeather walked to school with Lotus every day after that.\n\n74\n00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,560\nAnd every day the other kids danced with them.\n\n75\n00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,280\nLotus's whistle was no longer sad, but full of joy.\n\n76\n00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,140\nOne night, Lotus was awakened by Feather's urgent crows.\n\n77\n00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,820\nGrandpa opened the door to find their front steps underwater.\n\n78\n00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,520\nA faraway earthquake had vibrated the lake and flooded the village.\n\n79\n00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,880\n\"We have to alert the neighbors,\" said Grandpa.\n\n80\n00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,240\nHe and Lotus jumped into their boat.\n\n81\n00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,580\nFeather stood tall on the bow.\n\n82\n00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,280\n\"Wake up!\n\n83\n00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,800\nThe lake has flooded!\"\n\n84\n00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,160\nGrandpa shouted as they poled past the dark homes.\n\n85\n00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,200\nLotus struck the metal pail with a bamboo stick, again making a noise like thunder.\n\n86\n00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,940\nFeather crowed.\n\n87\n00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,660\nHouse by house, neighbors came out and jumped into their boats.\n\n88\n00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,800\nOver three hundred villagers were saved.\n\n89\n00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,520\nFeather was the hero.\n\n90\n00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,260\nFeather's story was reported in the local\nnewspaper, and he became famous throughout the province.\n\n91\n00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,060\nPeople stopped by to see the rare bird and\nhear the story again.\n\n92\n00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,530\nGrandpa told them how the crane had been shot.\n\n93\n00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,000\nHe asked for their help in keeping hunters\naway from the lake.\n\n94\n00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,680\nLotus always blew her whistle and let Feather\ndance for the guests.\n\n95\n00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,760\nMarch arrived.\n\n96\n00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,440\nBirds began appearing in the sky, migrating back north.\n\n97\n00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,240\nFeather's wings were still too weak for flying,\nbut he watched the flocks until they disappeared.\n\n98\n00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,220\nWill Feather leave us?\n\n99\n00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,820\nLotus asked Grandpa with her hands.\n\n100\n00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,560\nShe was frightened by Feather's longing stare.\n\n101\n00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,220\n\"That's where his home is,\" Grandpa said.\n\n102\n00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,820\nLotus looked down.\n\n103\n00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:22,920\nShe didn't want her friend to leave, but she\nknew she would never separate him from his home and family.\n\n104\n00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,200\nQuietly, she searched more rocks and climbed more trees to find him food;\n\n105\n00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,140\nat night she stroked him longer and hugged him tighter.\n\n106\n00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,800\nThen, one day, Feather spread his wings wide and leaped into the sky.\n\n107\n00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,300\nHe didn't go far, but Lotus could see that he was completely healed.\n\n108\n00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,740\nShe stroked his wing, and her tears dripped onto his soft feathers.\n\n109\n00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,760\nShe knew the time had come for him to leave.\n\n110\n00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,200\nLotus walked slowly behind Grandpa as he carried Feather to the lake.\n\n111\n00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,700\nHe held Feather high and tossed him gently into the air.\n\n112\n00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,660\nFeather flew up, circled a few times, but landed back at Lotus's feet.\n\n113\n00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,310\nGrandpa tried again. Again Feather returned.\n\n114\n00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:26,760\n\"He is waiting for you,\" Grandpa said, handing Feather to Lotus.\n\n115\n00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,260\nLotus buried her head in Feather's warm body for a long time.\n\n116\n00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:40,760\nWhen she heard another flock of birds passing overhead, she hugged Feather one more time,\n\n117\n00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,420\nand then threw him into the sky.\n\n118\n00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,420\nFeather hovered and circled, circled and hovered.\n\n119\n00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,400\nLotus waved good-bye, holding her tears back.\n\n120\n00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:03,920\nWith a long crow, Feather flapped his big wings and soared north, disappearing into the horizon.\n\n121\n00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,300\nLotus missed Feather.\n\n122\n00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,520\nSo did her schoolmates.\n\n123\n00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,240\nWhen Lotus climbed up the hill that faced north, her friends followed.\n\n124\n00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,270\nThey sat around her and listened to her whistle.\n\n125\n00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,480\nHer notes, filled with love and yearning, floated into the sky.\n\n126\n00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,800\nThey all believed Feather could hear them, wherever he was.\n\n127\n00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,680\nOne early morning in autumn, Lotus heard a crow outside.\n\n128\n00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,430\nShe jumped off her bed, ran to the door, and pushed it open...\n\n129\n00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,980\nFeather, as white as snow, stood on the\ndoorstep.\n\n130\n00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,120\nBehind him was a beautiful red-beaked female, and a chick.\n\n131\n00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,940\nFeather's family!\n\n132\n00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,720\nMoving slowly, so as not to frighten the birds, Lotus held out her hand.\n\n133\n00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,120\nFeather stretched his neck over and rubbed her palm.\n\n134\n00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,080\nThen, Lotus heard a commotion. She looked up and gasped.\n\n135\n00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,700\nShe tugged on Grandpa's arm and they ran to the lake.\n\n136\n00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,260\nThe sky turned white as it was filled by hundreds of cranes.\n\n137\n00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,040\nThey were circling and diving, singing and dancing around them.\n\n138\n00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,880\n\"Feather has brought his entire flock! Another miracle!\" Grandpa said.\n\n139\n00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,300\n\"The lake will not be lonely this year.\"\n\n140\n00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,240\nLotus grinned. She twirled and pranced with Feather and his friends.\n\n141\n00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:43,140\nHer whistle, accompanied by the birds' singing, echoed far, far away in the golden sky.\n\n142\n00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:54,220\nI think my favorite part of the book was when Lotus realized that she had to let Feather go back to join his family;\n\n143\n00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:02,260\nand we always have to remember they are wild creatures and they deserve to be free as we all do.\n\n144\n00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,920\nSo for me, for a young child to come to understanding with that, um, was very special.\n\n145\n00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,300\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n146\n00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,360\nMake sure to check out all of our stories.\n\n147\n00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,740\nKeep watching, and keep reading.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,240\nHi there. Welcome to Screen Actors Guild Foundation BookPALS.\n\n2\n00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:12,990\nI am Melissa Gilbert and I am the President of Screen Actors Guild,\n\n3\n00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:23,660\nbut more importantly, I am the mother of Mikey and Dakota and the stepmother of Sam and Lee, and one of our favorite things to do is to read.\n\n4\n00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:34,680\nSo it is going to be my pleasure to read to you today this book, \"My Rotten Redheaded Older Brother\" by Patricia Polacco.\n\n5\n00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,040\nHere we go.\n\n6\n00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,840\nMy brother and our mother and I all lived with my grandparents on their farm in Union City, Michigan.\n\n7\n00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:52,560\nNow my babushka, my grandmother, knew lots of things. She knew just how to tell a good story.\n\n8\n00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:01,720\nShe knew how to make ordinary things magical. And she knew how to make the best chocolate cake in Michigan.\n\n9\n00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:08,520\nAfter she told my brother and me a grand tale from her homeland, we'd always ask, \"Bubbie, is that true?\"\n\n10\n00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,900\nShe'd answer, \"Of course is true, but it may not have happened!\" Then she'd laugh.\n\n11\n00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:26,020\nNow, I knew that she loved me all right, but I couldn't quite understand how she could even like my older brother, Richard.\n\n12\n00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:34,040\nHe had orange hair that was like wire; he was covered in freckles and looked like a weasel with glasses.\n\n13\n00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,640\nThe one thing that my Bubbie didn't seem to know was how perfectly awful my brother really was!\n\n14\n00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:50,360\nMind you, he was always nice whenever she was around us; but as soon as she'd leave, he would do something terrible to me and laugh.\n\n15\n00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,500\nThere were so many things that I couldn't stand about him.\n\n16\n00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:01,820\nThe worst was that he was always telling me he could do just about everything better than I.\n\n17\n00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,980\n\"Bet I can pick more blackberries than you can,\" he jeered at me one day.\n\n18\n00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,540\n\"No you can't.\"\n\"Can so.\"\n\"Cannot!\"\n\n19\n00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,620\n\"Can,\" he whispered.\n\"Not,\" I said louder.\n\n20\n00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:19,640\n\"Can!\" he whispered so low that I could hardly hear him.  \"Not!\" I screamed back.\n\n21\n00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,660\nWe both picked berries for most of the afternoon.\n\n22\n00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:36,840\nWell, he upped and did it!  He not only picked more berries than I, he set a record that wasn't even challenged for the next ten years.\n\n23\n00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,960\n\"You make me sick, Richard Barber!\" I yelled at him.\n\n24\n00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:48,439\nThen he smiled that smile that only a rotten redheaded older brother could smile.\n\n25\n00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,460\nI guess I would have to face it.\n\n26\n00:02:51,460 --> 00:03:01,600\nHe could run the fastest, climb the highest, throw the farthest, sit the longest, get the dirtiest, burp the loudest, and spit the farthest.\n\n27\n00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,180\nHe had no equal, certainly not me!\n\n28\n00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,340\n\"And I'm four years older than you...  Always have been and always will be,\" he sneered.\n\n29\n00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,340\nThere had to be something– SOMETHING I could do that he couldn't!\n\n30\n00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,599\nThen an inspired thought comforted me like a fresh breeze on a hot summer day.\n\n31\n00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,889\n\"Oh, Richie,\" I cooed as I stood next to the rhubarb bushes. \"Do you like rhubarb?\"\n\n32\n00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,809\n\"No!\" he said.  \"It's the sourest stuff on this planet!\"\n\n33\n00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:45,039\nNow I knew, at long last, that I had him.\n\n34\n00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,560\n\"Bet I can eat more of this raw rhubarb than you can without getting the puckers!\"  I challenged.\n\n35\n00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,960\n\"I don't think so!\"\n\"I do!\"\n\"I don't!\" he said, narrowing his eyes.\n\n36\n00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,340\n\"I do!\" I insisted.\n\"Don't,\" he hissed, looking smug.\n\n37\n00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,900\n\"Do,\" I said furiously as I grabbed the first stalk and started chewing it almost down to the leaf.\n\n38\n00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:14,820\nWhen I couldn't get one more sour bite into my mouth, he was still eating with relish.\n\n39\n00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:21,200\n\"I thought you said you don't like rhubarb,\" I said through pursed lips.\n\n40\n00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,820\n\"I don't like it... I love it!\" he announced as he popped the last stalk into his mouth.\n\n41\n00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,000\nI was so mad, I couldn't even feel how my belly was starting to ache.\n\n42\n00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,220\n\"I can't stand you, Richard Barber...  I double dog can't stand you!\" I screamed as I went into the house to be consoled by my grandmother.\n\n43\n00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:54,280\n\"Yeah, and I'm four years older than you, too, you little twerp...  Always have been and always will be!\"  he called after me.\n\n44\n00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,919\nThen he laughed that rotten redheaded older brother laugh.\n\n45\n00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,729\nThat night at dinner I could hardly eat.\n\n46\n00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:11,780\n\"Have you been eating angry apples again, child?\" Bubbie asked as she sliced me a huge wedge of rhubarb pie.\n\n47\n00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,720\n\"I baked your favorite!\"\n\n48\n00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,060\nRichard gave me one of his extra-rotten, weasel-eyed, greeny-toothed grins.\n\n49\n00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,480\nAt bedtime my Bubbie came and sat on the edge of my bed like she did every night.\n\n50\n00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,180\n\"Look, a falling star,\" she said.\n\n51\n00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:37,900\nWe watched it streak across the sky. Then she spit twice between her fingers and gave her chest a loud slap.\n\n52\n00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,840\n\"Why did you do that, Bubbie?\" I asked.\n\n53\n00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,740\n\"I was making a wish... Didn't you know that wishes on falling stars come true?\"\n\n54\n00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:54,220\nAt last I knew how I was going to get back at my brother.\n\n55\n00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,180\nFor the longest time I watched the dark sky until I saw a star shoot across the night.\n\n56\n00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,220\nThen I spit between my two fingers and slapped my chest.\n\n57\n00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,460\nIt was done.\n\n58\n00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:15,300\nMy wish was to do something– anything– better than my brother.  I'd show him!\n\n59\n00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,780\nThe next morning all I could think about was my wish.\n\n60\n00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:26,830\nI was thinking about it so hard I almost didn't notice the wagons and trucks pulling into the field down the road near Four Corners.\n\n61\n00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,240\n\"A traveling carnival,\" my brother shouted as he ran toward me.\n\n62\n00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,110\n\"They're setting up right here in our field! I bet I can eat more hot dogs than you can,\" he teased.\n\n63\n00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:47,520\nHe was already starting it, but this time I was going to do something so incredible that even he would have to sit up and take notice.\n\n64\n00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,640\nI had a star wish. I'd show my rotten redheaded older brother, alright.\n\n65\n00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:07,319\nThat night I ran straight for the merry-go-round. We must have taken fifty turns on that carousel. But then my brother got off!\n\n66\n00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,460\nI stayed on. I went around and around and around.\n\n67\n00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:20,320\n\"I knew I could do this longer than you,\" I shouted to my brother, feeling proud but just a bit dizzy.\n\n68\n00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,480\n\"Treesha,\" I heard my Bubbie call out.  \"Get off from that thing...  It's time to go home!\"\n\n69\n00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:37,319\nThe last thing I remembered was stepping off from the platform. Next thing I knew I woke up with Bubbie sitting on the edge of my bed.\n\n70\n00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:44,919\nMom and Grandpa were there, too. \"You gave us all a fright!\" Momma said. \"How do you feel?\"\n\n71\n00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:54,129\n\"What happened?\" I asked. \"You fell!\" my rotten redheaded older brother announced with the biggest grin on his face.\n\n72\n00:07:54,129 --> 00:08:03,400\n\"I don't know what we would have done,\" my Bubbie said softly.  \"Your brother carried you all the way home, and then he had to run to get Dr. Lee.\"\n\n73\n00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,339\n\"You had to have stitches...  I watched it all!\" he said excitedly.\n\n74\n00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,240\n\"You fell off the merry-go-round right into some pop bottles,\" my gramps added.\n\n75\n00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,879\n\"You even passed out!\" my brother chirped. \"Looks like you finally did something special!\"\n\n76\n00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:26,159\nIt was from that exact moment that our relationship changed somehow.\n\n77\n00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,979\n\"Thanks, Richie,\" I said to him.\n\n78\n00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:34,240\n\"What's a big brother for, anyway,\" he said blushing.\n\n79\n00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,820\nThat night we were all out in the yard. On hot Michigan nights it was my family's custom to sleep outside, where it was cool.\n\n80\n00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,720\n\"Look at those stars,\" Bubbie said quietly.\n\n81\n00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,540\n\"Wishes are funny, aren't they,\" I said.  \"Sometimes they come true differently than you think they will.\"\n\n82\n00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:02,360\n\"That's why you have to be very careful what you wish for...  it just may come true!\" Bubbie said.\n\n83\n00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,410\nThen she squeezed both of our hands.  \"Hang onto the grass,\" she whispered.\n\n84\n00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,640\n\"Why, Bub?\" my brother asked.\n\n85\n00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:20,170\n\"Because if we don't we might float up to the stars.\"  Then she leaned over and kissed us both three times.\n\n86\n00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:33,940\n\"I kiss your eyes, and I hold both of your hearts in my good keeping. And this night I thank God that I walk this earth with both of you. Amen!\"\n\n87\n00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,580\nThen we all just lay on our blankets in the gentle summer night.\n\n88\n00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:47,680\n\"I'll always be four years older than you, though,\" my brother whispered softly. Then he smiled.\n\n89\n00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,400\nAll of us held one another's hands, and then we all drifted off to sleep.\n\n90\n00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:02,480\nThe End. Well, I hope you enjoyed that as much as I enjoyed reading it to you.\n\n91\n00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,680\nThank you so much for joining me here for SAG Foundation BookPALS. Bye.",

I'm Tia Mowry.\n--And I'm Tamera Mowry from \"Sister, Sister.\"\n\n2\n00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,719\nWelcome to the Screen Actors Guild Foundation BookPALS.\n\n3\n00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,560\nAnd today, we're going to be reading \"No Mirrors in my Nana's House.\"\n\n4\n00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:23,140\nYou know, Tamera, when I was first introduced to this book, I was very intrigued by the title, \"No Mirrors in My Nana's House\"\n\n5\n00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:30,440\nand I actually, you know, had to ask myself, how would this world, or how would our society actually be without any mirrors?\n\n6\n00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,400\nI mean, would there be any stereotypes?\n\n7\n00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:42,720\nI liked the book because I thought it sounded like a song and it kind of had a wonderful rhythm to it. So I'm very excited.\n\n8\n00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,240\nI think it's very colorful and fun.\n\n9\n00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:56,060\nThe author of the book is Ysaye Barnwell and the illustrations and paintings are by Synthia Saint James.\n\n10\n00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,140\nThere were no mirrors in my Nana's house\n\n11\n00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,640\nNo mirrors in my Nana's house\n\n12\n00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,340\nSo the beauty that I saw in everything\n\n13\n00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,560\nThe beauty in everything\n\n14\n00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,440\nWas in her eyes like the rising of the sun.\n\n15\n00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,960\nThere were no mirrors in my Nana's house\n\n16\n00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,390\nNo mirrors in my Nana's house\n\n17\n00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,080\nSo I never knew that my skin was too black\n\n18\n00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,480\nI never knew that my nose was too flat\n\n19\n00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,490\nI never knew that my clothes didn't fit\n\n20\n00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,540\nI never knew there were things that I missed\n\n21\n00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,860\n'Cause the beauty in everything was in her eyes\n\n22\n00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,240\nLike the rising of the sun.\n\n23\n00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,300\nThere were no mirrors in my Nana's house\n\n24\n00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,720\nNo mirrors in my Nana's house\n\n25\n00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,820\nI was intrigued by the cracks in the wall\n\n26\n00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,260\nI tasted with joy the dust that would fall\n\n27\n00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,240\nThe noise in the hallway was music to me\n\n28\n00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,600\nThe trash and the rubbish just cushioned my feet\n\n29\n00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,440\nAnd the beauty in everything was in her eyes,\n\n30\n00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,840\nlike the rising of the sun was in her eyes.\n\n31\n00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,160\nThere were no mirrors in my Nana's house\n\n32\n00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,460\nNo mirrors in my Nana's house\n\n33\n00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,860\nThe world outside was a magical place\n\n34\n00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,499\nI only knew love and I never knew hate\n\n35\n00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,660\nAnd the beauty in everything was in her eyes\n\n36\n00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,900\nlike the rising of the sun\n\n37\n00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:44,020\nChil', look deep into my eyes\n\n38\n00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,400\nRemember in the beginning when I told you this book reminded me of a song?\n\n39\n00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,880\nActually, it was inspired by a song.\n\n40\n00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,200\nAnd you know the author, Ysaye Barnwell, she's in a group called \"Sweet Honey and the Rock.\"\n\n41\n00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,240\nAnd now, we get to listen to them sing: \"No Mirrors in My Nana's House.\"\n\n42\n00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,440\nThere were no mirrors in my Nana's

00:04:32,160\nThe trash and the rubbish would cushion my feet\n\n60\n00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,220\nAnd the beauty in everything\nWas in her eyes\n\n61\n00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,560\nLike the rising

This belongs to you.”\n\n144\n00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,380\nSmilin’ Jack shook his head. “No ma’am.\n\n145\n00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,060\nThat money belongs to anybody who needs it for rent or food.\n\n146\n00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,780\nI’ve already been paid.\n\n147\n00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,660\nThis was the most fun I’ve had in a long time.\n\n148\n00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,800\nWherever I go from now on, I’m going to play at least one rent party like this.\n\n149\n00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,940\nWe’ll show those rent men how good folks help each other.”\n\n150\n00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,460\nSonny walked Smilin’ Jack back to Jackson Square.\n\n151\n00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,060\n“Thank you, Sonny Comeaux, for one of the happiest\nnights of my life,” Smilin’ Jack said.\n\n152\n00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,100\n“I sure hope to see you the next time I come to town.\n\n153\n00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,800\nI know just where to find you now.”\n\n154\n00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,240\nThey shook hands and hugged like old friends.\n\n155\n00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,440\nSonny walked home slowly, wishing the night would never end.\n\n156\n00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,180\nHe was glad he had listened to Mama.\n\n157\n00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,600\nIf he had quit school and taken a second job,\n\n158\n00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,460\nhe would never have met Smilin’ Jack,\n\n159\n00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,660\nnever have learned about bringing the neighbors together for a rent party.\n\n160\n00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,600\nIt made him think about how much people could do for one another\n\n161\n00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680\nif they put their minds and hearts to it.\n\n162\n00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,700\nSonny figured he would stay in school and learn everything in his books and lessons.\n\n163\n00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,140\nAnd maybe, just maybe, he’d learn to play the trumpet, too.\n\n164\n00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,920\nBeneath the bright glow of the street lamps,\n\n165\n00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:14,080\nSonny swayed back and forth, pretending he could blow a mean horn.\n\n166\n00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,540\nI love Rent Party Jazz because\n\n167\n00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,500\nAfrican-American characters are the focus of the story,\n\n168\n00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,120\nIt's about jazz and it's about people helping one another.\n\n169\n00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,660\nGreat message.\n\n170\n00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,620\nI grew up in Rhode Island and I...

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:10,159\nHey, I'm Caitlin Wachs and welcome to Storyline Online brought to you by the Screen Actor's Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:18,300\nAnd today I'm going to be reading to you \"Sebastian's Roller Skates\" written by Joan de Déu Prats, illustrated by Francesc Rovira.\n\n3\n00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:24,920\nSebastian didn't talk very much, even though he had a lot to say.\n\n4\n00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,300\nSebastian was shy. He was very shy.\n\n5\n00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,820\nThe neighbors would say, \"My goodness Sebastian, you're getting tall!\"\n\n6\n00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,500\nAnd Sebastian would look at the floor, nod his head, and blush.\n\n7\n00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,740\nWhat he wanted to say though, was that someday he'd like to be tall enough to reach every single button in the elevator, even the ones at the very top.\n\n8\n00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,160\nBut Sebastian didn't talk very much.\n\n9\n00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,440\n\"How's school?\" the barber would ask, wrapping Sebastian in a cape.\n\n10\n00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,410\nAnd Sebastian would look down at his feet, blush, and whisper, \"Fine.\"\n\n11\n00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,940\nWhat he wanted to say though, was that he loved geography, and that he knew the names of faraway seas, tropical islands, and desert lands.\n\n12\n00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,670\nWhen the barber was finished he'd ask Sebastian how he liked his haircut.\n\n13\n00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,870\nAnd in a very small voice, Sebastian would whisper, \"Fine,\" again.\n\n14\n00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:18,220\nWhat he wanted to say though, was that if the barber made his head look like a billiard ball next time, he'd regret it.\n\n15\n00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,780\nSebastian didn't talk very much. Not in the elevator. Not in the barbershop. Not in school.\n\n16\n00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,520\nWhen the teacher would ask him to name the capital of Iceland, the capital of Mongolia, or the capital of Burundi,\n\n17\n00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,200\nSebastian would just look down at his desk, because even though he knew the answers, he couldn't seem to say anything.\n\n18\n00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,250\nSebastian sat in the last row, right behind Ester.  Ester had curly hair and eyes the color of honey.\n\n19\n00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,160\nSebastian liked Ester, but he'd never spoken to her.\n\n20\n00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:57,780\nAfter school, Sebastian always walked home through the park. One afternoon, he noticed a pair of old roller skates.\n\n21\n00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,020\nSebastian had never skated before, but he'd always wanted to try.\n\n22\n00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,020\nHe waited a few minutes, and when no one approached, he decided to try them on.\n\n23\n00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,080\nHe stood up very slowly, took a careful step, and...\n\n24\n00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,540\nWham! Right on his rear end!\n\n25\n00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,760\nHe tried again. And again, the same thing happened.\n\n26\n00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,359\n\"Skating is not for me,\" Sebastian thought.\n\n27\n00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,620\nHe took off the skates, put them back on the bench, and walked home.\n\n28\n00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,400\nThe next day, when Sebastian walked though the park, he saw that the skates were still there, right where he had left them.\n\n29\n00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,969\nSebastian scratched his nose. He looked right. He looked left. Nobody was around.\n\n30\n00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:46,740\nThis time he was able to stand up, and stay up. But when he tried to take a step, he fell.\n\n31\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,520\nBut at least he'd stood up! Maybe he should take the skates home...\n\n32\n00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,999\nAfter that, Sebastian went to the park every day after school to practice.\n\n33\n00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,900\nHe always went slowly and carefully, taking tiny steps until he could grab on to something – a lamp post, a tree, a railing.\n\n34\n00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,260\nOnce, he even tried to grab on to someone's moustache!\n\n35\n00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:16,920\nSebastian skated every day, and every day he got a little bit better, but after a week he still couldn't go very far or very fast.\n\n36\n00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,600\nThen he saw some other skaters gliding by, as if it were the easiest thing in the world.\n\n37\n00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,180\nHe sat down on the bench, sad and a tiny bit heartbroken. Then he went home.\n\n38\n00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,780\nHe was back the next afternoon though.\n\n39\n00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:38,689\nHe put the skates on, and then, just like always, he started to skate very slowly, first one foot, then the other.\n\n40\n00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:42,760\nHe was concentrating so hard, he didn't hear the shouting,\n\n41\n00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,460\n\"My dog! Somebody, please! Help me catch my dog!\"\n\n42\n00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,279\nSuddenly, a big dog was licking his face.  Sebastian had to grab him to keep from falling down.\n\n43\n00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:56,949\nJust then, the dog started to run, and somehow, Sebastian managed to hold on to the leash.\n\n44\n00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:00,509\nWhat happened next is something Sebastian could never have imagined--\n\n45\n00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:06,159\n--he skated as if he were a water skiier, gliding gracefully behind the big dog.\n\n46\n00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,820\nThey crossed the bridge over the pond, they crossed the path that led to the grove,\n\n47\n00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,740\nthey crossed the playground with the swings,\n\n48\n00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,820\n–they even jumped over a ditch where workers were repairing a pipe.\n\n49\n00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,700\nSebastian kept his balance the whole time, until finally, the dog stopped running.\n\n50\n00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:24,260\nThe dog's owner came for her dog, but Sebastian just stood there.\n\n51\n00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,520\nHe'd skated through practically the whole park!  He could hardly believe it!\n\n52\n00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,640\nWhen he got back to his apartment building, a neighbor was waiting for the elevator.\n\n53\n00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,220\n\"How are things, Sebastian?\" the neighbor asked.\n\n54\n00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:42,040\nAt first Sebastian didn't say anything.  He started to shrug like he usually did, but then he stopped.\n\n55\n00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,980\nHis face brightened, and he answered without thinking, \"Great!  I'm learning how to roller skate.\"\n\n56\n00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,040\nThe next day was Saturday, and Sebastian spent the whole morning skating without ever worrying about falling down.\n\n57\n00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:01,180\nHe skated through the whole park, and even though he did fall down twice, both times he got up right away and kept on skating.\n\n58\n00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,040\nSebastian began to worry less about other things, too.\n\n59\n00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,100\nWhen he had to go to the barbershop again, and the barber asked, \"How's school?\" Sebastian did not lower his eyes or answer in a whisper.\n\n60\n00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,300\nInstead, he just opened his mouth...\n\n61\n00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:23,280\n\"I know the names of all the most important deserts in the world and where they are: the Sahara in Africa, the Gobi in Asia, and the Atacama in South America.\"\n\n62\n00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,560\n\"How about that?\" the barber said in surprise.\n\n63\n00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,440\n\"And this time I don't want my head to look like a billiard ball!\"\n\n64\n00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,240\nWhen Sebastian left the barbershop, he could hardly believe what he had done.\n\n65\n00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,979\nHe had a lot to say, and he'd said it!\n\n66\n00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,460\nSo now, when the teacher asked, \"Let's see, who knows the names of the tallest mountains in the world?\"\n\n67\n00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,420\nSebastian would put up his hand and answer, \"Mount Everest, Qogir, and Kangchenjunga.\"\n\n68\n00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,720\nHe still had something else he wanted to do though.\n\n69\n00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,420\nSo one afternoon, when he saw Ester, the little girl with curly hair, he made up his mind.\n\n70\n00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,500\nHe didn't fall very much anymore when he skated, and sometimes when he had a lot to say, he said it,\n\n71\n00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,280\nso he walked over to Ester and asked with a smile,\n\n72\n00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,820\n\"Would you like to go skating with me?\"\n\n73\n00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,120\nAnd guess what? Ester was a little bit shy.\n\n74\n00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,280\nBut she did whisper, \"Yes.\"\n\n75\n00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,720\nSebastian went home feeling very happy. He broke his piggy bank and ran to the store to buy himself a new pair of skates.\n\n76\n00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,580\nThen he went to the park and returned the old roller skates to the same bench where he had found them.\n\n77\n00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:36,840\nHe thought maybe somebody else who didn't talk very much, even when they had a lot to say, might also like to learn how to skate.",

It's where I buy my FOOD.\"\n\n20\n00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,860\nSnappsy looked hungrily at the other shoppers...\n\n21\n00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,160\n...while loading his cart with pudding, peanut butter, pita bread, and popcorn.\n\n22\n00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,720\nYes, Snappsy the alligator was particularly fond of a certain letter of the alphabet.\n\n23\n00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,180\n\"I don't only eat food that starts with the letter P.\n\n24\n00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,780\nYou don't have to make it seem like I only buy storybook food.\n\n25\n00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,780\nI'm also buying cheddar, apples, pretzels, pasta, pears—\"\n\n26\n00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,900\nAha!\n\n27\n00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,680\n\"It's just a coincidence!\"\n\n28\n00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:21,340\nSnappsy, the big, mean, hungry alligator, who only liked food that started with the letter P,\n\n29\n00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,380\ncarried his groceries back through the forest, back down the hill, back around the pond,\n\n30\n00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,560\nuntil he got to a surprisingly lopsided shack.\n\n31\n00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,180\n\"Oh, you are really cheesing me off.\n\n32\n00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,580\nIt's my house. I built it myself.\"\n\n33\n00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,900\nI'll say.\n\n34\n00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,540\nSnappsy the alligator took his groceries into his splinter-laden shed and slammed the door. Quite hard.\n\n35\n00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,700\nHe was inside.\n\n36\n00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,000\nStill inside.\n\n37\n00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,460\nWhat was he doing in there?\n\n38\n00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,780\nWas he making crafty plans?\n\n39\n00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,840\nWas he roasting innocent forest creatures that he already had stored in his freezer?\n\n40\n00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,360\nHad he fallen asleep?\n\n41\n00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,700\n\"I made a peanut butter sandwich and now I'm reading a book.\"\n\n42\n00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,420\nWell, you have to come out. The story is really boring now.\n\n43\n00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,840\n\"If you must know, I'm planning a party.\"\n\n44\n00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:32,380\nSnappsy the alligator, trying to better his reputation with the other animals, decided to throw a party.\n\n45\n00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,500\nSnappsy vacuumed the rug.\n\n46\n00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,520\nHe made goody bags for all his guests.\n\n47\n00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,840\nWait, those aren't goody bags. He's just taking out the garbage.\n\n48\n00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,860\nSnappsy should really put out goody bags for his guests. They love those.\n\n49\n00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,960\n\"You know what? I did not ask to be in this book!\n\n50\n00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,740\nI was just having a normal day!\n\n51\n00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:05,520\nAnd suddenly you were talking about what I was doing, so I'm throwing a party to make things more interesting!\n\n52\n00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,540\nI hope you're happy! Now I just want you to buzz off!\"\n\n53\n00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,860\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n54\n00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,460\n\"Oh, go ahead! I can hear you breathing!\"\n\n55\n00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,320\nSnappsy's party was shaping up to be quite a festive event.\n\n56\n00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,580\nColorful streamers hung from the ceiling.\n\n57\n00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,140\nThere were cubes of cheese and a bowl of punch.\n\n58\n00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,760\nSome kind of danceable music was playing.\n\n59\n00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,820\nThen Snappsy's friends started to arrive.\n\n60\n00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,540\nThey were laughing and dancing. They weren't hungry or thirsty.\n\n61\n00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,160\nThey looked like they were having a really good time.\n\n62\n00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,580\nYes, a fine time indeed...\n\n63\n00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,840\n\"Oh, all right! You can come in!\"\n\n64\n00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,920\nOh gosh. Me?!\n\n65\n00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,020\nThe humble narrator?\n\n66\n00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,940\nWell, I don't know.\n\n67\n00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,340\nLet me check my calendar.\n\n68\n00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320\nI suppose I could come for an hour or two.\n\n69\n00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,300\nSomeone has to demonstrate proper dance steps.\n\n70\n00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,140\nAll the important guests had finally arrived.\n\n71\n00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:26,620\nAnd while Snappsy's sharp teeth were still glinting menacingly, he was actually a lovely host.\n\n72\n00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,020\n\"Does anyone want pudding?\"\n\n73\n00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,220\nAha!\n\n74\n00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,140\n\"Because pudding is really good.\"\n\n75\n00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,800\nAnd we all ate pudding and did the Chicken Dance.\n\n76\n00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,480\nWe were really looking forward to Snappsy throwing parties like this every week.\n\n77\n00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120\nHey!\n\n78\n00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,540\nThe end.\n\n79\n00:05:51,840 --> 00:06:02,780\nI love reading.

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:01,489 --> 00:00:12,619\nHello, I'm Hector Elizondo. You're watching Storyline Online brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation and BookPALS.\n\n2\n00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:21,640\nToday I'll be reading something special. A very special story and a favorite of my granddaughter, when she was smaller, of course.\n\n3\n00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:38,970\n\"Somebody Loves You, Mr. Hatch\" is the story today, and it's written by Eileen Spinelli, illustrated by Paul Yalowitz. Get ready, this is a gooder.\n\n4\n00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:45,600\nMr. Hatch was tall and thin and he did not smile.\n\n5\n00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,880\nEvery morning at 6:30 sharp he would leave his brick house and walk eight blocks to the shoelace factory where he worked.\n\n6\n00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:06,540\nAt lunch time he would sit alone in a corner, eat his cheese and mustard sandwich, and drink a cup of coffee.  Sometimes he brought a prune for dessert.\n\n7\n00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:17,570\nAfter work he would make two stops: at the newsstand to get the paper, and at the grocery store to buy a fresh turkey wing for his supper.\n\n8\n00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,640\nAfter supper he read the paper, took a shower, and went to bed early.\n\n9\n00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,620\n\"He keeps to himself.\" \nThat is what everyone said about Mr. Hatch.\n\n10\n00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:39,770\nOne Saturday, when Mr. Hatch stepped onto the porch with his dustpan and broom, he got a surprise-- a package wrapped in brown paper.\n\n11\n00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,920\nHe had never spoken to the postman before.\n\"Thank you Mr. Goober,\" he said.\n\n12\n00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,189\nMr. Goober smiled. \"You're welcome. I always enjoy delivering packages.\"\n\n13\n00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:58,920\nMr. Hatch tore the brown paper off. Inside was a white box, which he opened to find another box.\n\n14\n00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,800\nThis one was heart-shaped-- all satiny red with a pink bow on top.\n\n15\n00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,780\nIt was filled with candy.\n\n16\n00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,820\nSomething fluttered to the porch floor. It was a little white card. He picked it up.\n\n17\n00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:22,260\nIt said, \"Somebody loves you.\" Only then did he remember that this was Valentine's Day.\n\n18\n00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:30,009\nMr. Hatch wondered and wondered. \"Now who would send this to me?\" He was all alone. He had no friends.\n\n19\n00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:34,320\nAnd yet someone, someone had sent him a valentine.\n\n20\n00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,689\nWho? Who?\n\n21\n00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:45,659\nHe put the box on the coffee table and tried to do some dusting, but every time he left the room he had to keep peeking to see if the box was still there.\n\n22\n00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:54,159\nHe dusted and dusted, and the dustcloth seemed to whisper: \"Somebody loves you... Somebody loves you... \"\n\n23\n00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,580\nAt last he flung the dustcloth away and exclaimed, \"I've got a secret admirer!\"\n\n24\n00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,340\nAnd then he did something he had never done before: he laughed.\n\n25\n00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,900\nHe laughed and danced and clapped his hands. And then he took a piece of candy from the box and ate it.\n\n26\n00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,080\nMr. Hatch changed his shirt and found some old aftershave in the bottom drawer. He splashed it on his face.\n\n27\n00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,620\nHe picked out a yellow tie with blue polka dots and put it on.\n\n28\n00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:33,359\nAnd then he went for a walk. \"Maybe,\" he thought, \"I will meet the person who sent me the candy.\"\n\n29\n00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:40,060\nOf course no one had ever seen Mr. Hatch wearing a tie, or smelling of aftershave, or smiling.\n\n30\n00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,709\nSo he got a lot of attention.\n\n31\n00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:48,000\nMrs. Weed tripped over her dog.\nMr. Dunwoody nearly fell off his ladder.\n\n32\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,069\nAnd little Tina Finn spilled all the toys out of her wagon.  Mr. Hatch waved hello to them all.\n\n33\n00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:02,540\nOn Monday it was back to work. At lunchtime Mr. Hatch sat in the middle of the cafeteria.\n\n34\n00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,079\nHe spoke to everyone and passed out chocolates from his heart box.\n\n35\n00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,359\nOn the way home, as usual, he stopped at the newsstand. Mr. Smith handed him the usual newspaper.\n\n36\n00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,060\n\"I think I'll have a pack of mints,\" said Mr. Hatch, not as usual.\n\n37\n00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:24,840\nMr. Smith was shocked. \"Was that you speaking, Mr. Hatch?\"\n\"Indeed it was,\" said Mr. Hatch.\n\n38\n00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:34,370\n\"I said I would also like a pack of mints. And if you don't mind my saying so, Mr. Smith, you don't look very well today.\"\n\n39\n00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:43,740\nMr. Smith recovered from his shock to reply, \"You're right. I don't feel very well. I have a cold.\n\n40\n00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,680\nI was supposed to go to the doctor's this afternoon, but the stand has been so busy I haven't had the time.\"\n\n41\n00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,880\nMr. Hatch smiled. \"Why, I'd be happy to watch the stand for you while you go.\"\n\n42\n00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,620\nMr. Smith could hardly believe his ears.  \"You would?\"\n\n43\n00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:08,020\n\"Certainly, just show me what to do.\" And so Mr. Hatch ran the newstand for an hour.\n\n44\n00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:15,899\nHe wondered if any of the women who stopped to buy a paper, or a magazine, or a candy bar, had sent him the mysterious valentine.\n\n45\n00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:23,330\nWhen Mr. Smith returned, Mr. Hatch made his usual stop at the grocery store.\n\n46\n00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:31,560\n\"I'm a little tired of turkey wings,\" he told Mr. Todd. \"I think I'll have a nice fresh slice of ham.\"\n\n47\n00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,720\nMr. Todd weighed the meat and wrapped it.\n\n48\n00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,039\n\"You look worried,\" said Mr. Hatch. \n\"I am,\" said Mr. Todd. \"My little girl is late.\"\n\n49\n00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:47,839\n\"She hasn't come home from school yet, and I can't leave the store to look for her until my wife arrives.\"\n\n50\n00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,460\n\"Goodness! Why didn't you say so?\" said Mr. Hatch. \"I will go look for her.\"\n\n51\n00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,479\nAnd so he walked to school and found little Melanie Todd by the swings and brought her home.\n\n52\n00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:05,400\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" said the grocer. \"Anytime,\" said Mr. Hatch.\n\n53\n00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:13,559\nAfter supper Mr. Hatch did not bother to read the paper. He decided to bake brownies instead.\n\n54\n00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:18,610\nIt would be nice to have brownies to share the next day with the people at the shoelace factory.\n\n55\n00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,720\nAs he baked, the warm chocolate smell of brownies floated through the neighborhood.\n\n56\n00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,140\nChildren gathered round Mr. Hatch's house, sniffing the air.\n\n57\n00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:37,940\n\"Well, I suppose the factory can wait,\" said Mr. Hatch as he looked out the window. And he brought out two platefuls.\n\n58\n00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,800\n\"Now what are brownies without lemonade?\" he said, and he stirred up a nice cold pitcher.\n\n59\n00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,979\nWhen the parents came to gather their children, they had some brownies too.\n\n60\n00:06:48,979 --> 00:07:00,309\nIt turned out to be a picnic in Mr. Hatch's backyard. He dusted off an old harmonica and played songs he remembered from his boyhood. Everyone danced.\n\n61\n00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:09,120\nAnd so the days and weeks went by. When Mr. Hatch wasn't smiling, he was laughing. And when he wasn't laughing he was helping someone.\n\n62\n00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,680\nAnd when he wasn't helping someone, he was having a party in his yard or on his porch.\n\n63\n00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,720\nHe seemed to have forgotten about finding the person who sent him the valentine.\n\n64\n00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:30,289\nThen one afternoon Mr. Goober, the postman, came to his door. His face was very serious.\n\n65\n00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:34,760\n\"Come in, Mr. Goober,\" said Mr. Hatch. \"You look upset.\"\n\n66\n00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:45,740\n\"I am upset, I made a mistake some time ago. My supervisor is very angry with me. Do you-- do you...\"\n\n67\n00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,039\n\"Yes, Mr. Goober? What is it?\"  \n\"Do you recall the package I delivered to you? On Valentine's Day, I think it was.\"\n\n68\n00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:57,069\n\"Yes, I believe so,\" replied Mr. Hatch, beginning to feel a little uneasy.\n\n69\n00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:11,379\n\"I don't suppose you still have it,\" said Mr. Goober sadly. \"As a matter of fact,\" said Mr. Hatch, \"I still have the box. The candy is gone, though. Why do you ask?\"\n\n70\n00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:19,489\nThe postman took a deep breath. \"I'm afraid I delivered it to the wrong address.  It was supposed to go to another house.\"\n\n71\n00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:25,549\nMr. Hatch recalled tearing off the brown paper. It had never occurred to him to look at the address.\n\n72\n00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:31,599\nHe fetched the heart-shaped box and the pink bow and gave them to the postman.\n\n73\n00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,320\n\"I do hope your supervisor won't be too angry with you now.\"\n\n74\n00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,040\nThe postman was heading down the sidewalk when Mr. Hatch called from his porch.\n\n75\n00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:48,580\n\"Mr. Goober, I forgot something!\" He gave the postman the little white card.\n\n76\n00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,490\n\"Somebody loves you,\" it said.\n\n77\n00:08:52,490 --> 00:09:00,540\nAlone in his living room, Mr. Hatch sighed. \"Nobody loved me after all.\"\n\n78\n00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:06,900\nThen he read the paper, took his shower, and went to bed early.\n\n79\n00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:15,330\nThe next morning at 6:30 sharp, Mr. Hatch left his brick house and walked eight blocks to the shoelace factory.\n\n80\n00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:25,440\nAt lunchtime he sat in the corner by himself, ate his cheese and mustard sandwich, and drank a cup of coffee.\n\n81\n00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,080\nAfter work he stopped at the newsstand for his paper, but he did not speak to Mr. Smith.\n\n82\n00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,940\nAnd when he ordered his turkey wing from Mr. Todd, he did not smile.\n\n83\n00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:46,280\nNor did he pat little Melanie Todd on the head or bake brownies or have picnics or parties or play his old harmonica anymore.\n\n84\n00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,860\nEveryone whispered, \"What is wrong with Mr. Hatch?\"\n\n85\n00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,280\nMr. Goober, the postman, told them.\n\n86\n00:09:52,280 --> 00:10:00,420\n\"We love Mr. Hatch,\" insisted Mr. and Mrs. Dunwoody. \"He gave us flowers for our garden. He helped to mend our back fence.\"\n\n87\n00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:09,390\nMrs. Weed nodded. \"I love him too. He saved his bones for my dog Ruffy.\"  \nRuffy barked-- she loved Mr. Hatch too.\n\n88\n00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,290\nMr. Smith told everyone how Mr. Hatch had watched his newsstand so he could visit the doctor.\n\n89\n00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,200\nAnd Mr. Todd told everyone how Mr. Hatch had found his little girl.\n\n90\n00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:27,420\nAll the children in the neighborhood remembered Mr. Hatch's wonderful brownies and lemonade. And most of all his laughter.\n\n91\n00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,840\n\"Poor Mr. Hatch,\" they said. \"What can we do?\"\n\n92\n00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,640\nThen Mr. Goober announced, \"I have an idea.\n\n93\n00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:47,500\nOn Saturday morning Mr. Hatch woke to a bright and sunny day. He put on his old overalls and went out to the porch with his dustpan and broom.\n\n94\n00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:54,540\nHe couldn't believe his eyes. All over the porch were red and white hearts and pink bows.\n\n95\n00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,840\nThere were boxes of candy on the chairs and yellow streamers flowing from the ceiling.\n\n96\n00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,740\nAnd sticking up out of his mailbox was a shining silver harmonica.\n\n97\n00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,100\nThe front yard was filled with people. Happy smiling people.\n\n98\n00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,300\nThey were holding up a huge sign with hand-painted letters.\n\n99\n00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,100\nIt said: EVERYBODY LOVES MR. HATCH.\n\n100\n00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:32,140\nMr. Hatch dabbed at a tear with his handkerchief. \"I do believe,\" he sniffed, \"somebody loves me after all.\"\n\n101\n00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:43,100\nAnd then he smiled. And then he laughed. And then he hurried down to be with his friends.\n\n102\n00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,840\nWell, if you don't like that, you don't like the dark chocolate with the nuts in it. You know...  you know what I mean.",
