		"text"		: "Narrator: Hello. This is the story of an ordinary girl called Alice. Our story begins on an ordinary summer's day. Let's meet Alice: here she is, sitting next to the river with her sister on a very hot summer's afternoon. Her sister is reading a book, and with no-one to talk to, Alice is bored… and a bit sleepy. Soon, she'll be in a Wonderland full of strange and wonderful adventures… but Alice doesn't know that yet…\nAlice: Ohh… There's nothing to do… except lie on the grass and pick daisies. Shall I make a daisy chain for my dear little Dinah? Oh… I don't know… it's sooo hot…  \nWhite Rabbit: Oh dear! Oh dear! I'm late! I'm so very late! Oh dear oh dear!\nAlice: A white rabbit! A talking white rabbit? Perhaps. But a rabbit with a pocket-watch? A rabbit with pockets? I must see where he's going!\nNarrator: Alice had never seen a rabbit with a pocket, or a waistcoat, or a pocket-watch before. So, she ran after the rabbit as fast as she could, and when the rabbit jumped down a large rabbit hole, Alice jumped straight after him.\nAlice: Oohhhh… Either this hole is very deep or I'm falling very slowly. And what a curious rabbit-hole! Who would think a rabbit-hole would have bookshelves … and books … and maps … and jars of marmalade?\nNarrator: Alice fell down, down, down. She fell for so long that she began to think about Dinah, her cat.\nAlice: Dinah will miss me tonight! I hope they'll remember her milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!\nNarrator: Alice was beginning to feel quite sleepy when suddenly, her fall was over and she found herself sitting on a pile of leaves and grass. \nAlice: Ouch! Who's there?\nWhite Rabbit: Oh, my ears and whiskers! How late it's getting!!\nAlice: Wait! Please sir, wait a moment!\nNarrator: The White Rabbit ran down a long tunnel. Alice ran after him. But when she reached the end of the tunnel she found only a long hall with doors all the way round. Alice tried to open the doors – but they were all locked. Then she saw a table with a tiny key on it.\nAlice: These doors are all too big. There must be a smaller door somewhere. I wonder… hmmm, let me look behind this little curtain… ooh! a tiny little door! Let me try the key… What a beautiful garden! But how can I visit it? The door is so tiny – I can't even fit my head through! Oh! It's no use. I wish I could fold up like a telescope! Wait a minute… what's this? It certainly wasn't here before. A bottle – I wonder what it is? Let me see the label. Hmmm: Drink me… Oh! Oh! Ohhhhhh!!!! What a curious feeling! I'm folding up like a telescope!\nNarrator: And so she was! Alice got smaller and smaller until she was small enough to fit through the door. But she'd forgotten something …\nAlice: The key!\nNarrator: Alice was too small to reach the key on the table. She tried and tried to climb up the table leg but it was too slippery. When she had tired herself out with trying, poor little Alice sat down and cried.\nAlice: It's no use. I can't reach the key, so I can't get into the garden and that's that. There's no use crying like that! Alice! I advise you to stop this minute! Oohh… what's this? A little glass box… with cake inside! Ooh: and there's a note. Eat me. Hmmm. I wonder if it will make me grow... if I grow, I will be able to reach the key. But what if makes me even smaller? Well, if it makes me smaller, I will be able to creep under the door.\nNarrator: And Alice began to eat the cake. Did she grow big enough to reach the key? Or perhaps the cake made her small enough to creep under the door and into her beautiful garden. I'll tell you what happened next time. Goodbye.",

		"text"		: "Narrator: Hello! Alice is having some very curious adventures at the bottom of a rabbit hole. She drank a drink that made her very small indeed. But she wants to grow bigger so that she can reach the key that will unlock the tiny door to a beautiful garden. After eating some cake she found in a little glass box, Alice started to feel something …\nAlice: Curiouser and curiouser! I'm growing! My feet are so far away. Goodbye feet! How will I put my shoes and socks on, I wonder? Ouch!\nNarrator: Alice grew so big that her head hit the ceiling! It was easy to reach the table now. She picked up the tiny key and rushed to the door. But in her excitement, she forgot something again…\nAlice: Ohhhh… this is hopeless! I'm much too big for this door now! I'll never get into the garden! I can only look through the door with one eye! Oh…\nNarrator: Alice was over nine feet tall, and when a girl that big cries, the tears are big too. Alice cried and cried until half the hall was filledwith a salty pool of tears. After a time, Alice heard a little pattering of feet in the distance. She dried her eyes to see what was coming.\nWhite Rabbit: Oh! I'm late! I'm so very late! I was told to be early and I'm going to be late. The Duchess will be waiting. Oh my! Oh my! She will be so very angry with me! Oh my!\nNarrator: The sight of The White Rabbit, splendidly dressed in his best clothes, and carrying a large fan and a pair of white leather gloves was enough to stop Alice's tears.\nAlice: If you please, sir…\nWhite Rabbit: Oh!! Oh my!\nAlice: Don't go! I won't hurt – Oh dear! You've dropped your gloves… But look: what a pretty fan. And crying is such hot work. Oh, that's better. Oh dear… how strange everything is today. Yesterday things were normal. But today I'm not sure if I am the same girl who woke up this morning. But, if I'm not the girl who woke up this morning, the question is, \"Who am I?\"\nNarrator: Alice fanned herself while she talked. She felt much cooler. But after a minute or two, something started happening.\nAlice: Oh: Here's that feeling again.\nNarrator: Then something kept happening. Alice kept fanning herself.\nAlice: I don't believe it. I must be… I am! I'm growing smaller again. Smaller than the table. Hello feet! It's good to see you again.\nNarrator: Soon Alice was smaller than ever. She was still shrinking and shrinking and she didn't know why.\nAlice: Oh dear - I'm getting very small. Oh… I'm getting much too small! Oh dear - I shall fade away altogether! Ohh…! The fan? The fan!\nNarrator: Just in time. Alice threw the fan on the floor, so she wouldn't get any smaller.  \nAlice: That was a lucky escape! But now I'm small enough to get into the garden!\nNarrator: Poor Alice! There she stood at the little door - but it was locked again. And there was the little key, back in its place, out of reach, on the table.\nAlice: Oh not again! This is hopeless. I'll never get that key now. I so badly wanted to see the garden. And things are worse than ever - I've never been so small as this in my life. Never!\nNarrator: Things were as bad as ever. And they were about to get worse...\nAlice: Ohhh!\nNarrator: And poor little Alice fell into a pool of her own tears. Luckily, she knew how to swim. But she wasn't the only one who had fallen into the pool. Next time, Alice meets a dodo, tries to make friends with a mouse, and joins in a very, very curious race. Goodbye.",

		"title"		: "The Caucus-race",
		"text"		: "Narrator: Hello. So far, Alice had been very small, then very tall, then very small again in this strange Wonderland she found when she chased a talking rabbit and fell down the rabbit hole. Now she was swimming in a pool of her own tears, wondering what was going to happen next.\nAlice: Ooh, whatever's this? It's a mouse! Hello mouse! You're a very big mouse… but then, I'm a very, very little girl today. Whatever next? If this mouse talks, I won't be at all surprised… Oh Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I'm very tired of swimming about here, Mouse! Mouse? Hmmm. Perhaps it doesn't understand English. Maybe it's a French mouse! Now, what was that French I learned in school? Où est ma chatte?\nMouse: Chatte? Cat! Did you say cat?!\nAlice: Oh, I'm so sorry Mouse! I forgot mice don't like cats.\nMouse: Would you like cats if you were me?\nAlice: Well… perhaps not. But my cat Dinah is different. She's such a sweet, quiet thing. If you meet her, I'm sure you'll like her.\nMouse: We won't talk about cats any more, thank you!\nAlice: We won't! Er… do you - do you er… like dogs? They can be so sweet and they kill all the rats… and… Oh dear!\nAlice: Oh please come back, dear Mouse. We won't talk about cats or dogs, if you don't like them. Swim with me to the shore.\nNarrator: So Alice and the mouse swam to the edge of the pool of tears. And as they swam, they were joined by lots of other creatures that had fallen into the pool, just like Alice and the mouse. There was a duck and a dodo and many other strange animals that Alice had never seen before. All the creatures had the same question.\nAnimals: How can we get dry? What can we do? I'm so far away from my nest, that pool was very wet and salty, oh it's no good for my fur, etc…\nDodo: We must have a Caucus-race!\nAnimals: Hooray! Hoorah!\nAlice: What's a Caucus-race, Mr Dodo?\nDodo: The best way to explain a Caucus-race is to have a Caucus-race!\nNarrator: It was the strangest race Alice had ever seen. The Dodo marked a circle for the racecourse and everyone stood anywhere they wanted to. Nobody said \"One, two, three, go!\" but everyone started running. Alice ran too, although she didn't quite know where she should run to. Everyone ran left and right in any direction they pleased. But after half an hour of running, everybody was quite dry again.\nDodo: The race is over!\nMultiple voices: But who has won? Did I win? Who is the winner?\nDodo: Ah... yes... Who has won? Who has won? Everybody has won and everyone must have prizes! And she must give the prizes!\nAlice: Me?\nNarrator: Alice didn't have any prizes for a Caucus-race with her, but she searched in her pockets and found some sweets. She had enough sweets to give exactly one sweet to every runner.  \nAlice: Here you are, one for you, and one for you…\nAnimals: Thank you very much… oh dear, this has no taste whatsoever… oh, I shall choke…it's rather good, yes very tasty…\nAlice: And one for you – now, does everybody have one? Oh, I must say, my cat Dinah would love a Caucus-race…\nAnimals: Let's go! Come away! Time for bed! Oh, is it that time already? Cats - ugh!\nAlice: Oh dear. I said it again. Come back! Please! I'm sorry! Poor Dinah. Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!\nNarrator: Poor Alice felt very lonely and sad. She cried quietly to herself for a while. But in a little while, she heard footsteps in the distance. She looked up to see who it was. Next time, I'll tell you who the footsteps belonged to, and how Alice got so big she filled a whole house, and what happened when she kicked poor Bill the lizard up and out of the chimney. Goodbye.",

		"title"		: "The White Rabbit's house",
		"text"		: "Narrator: Hello. Alice fell down a Rabbit Hole one day and found herself in a Wonderland, where animals talk, curious things happen and everything she eats and drinks makes her grow bigger or smaller. Now she is sitting alone. Suddenly, she heard footsteps. The White Rabbit was running towards her. He seemed to be very worried.\nWhite Rabbit: Oh dear! Where can I have dropped them? I must find them, or I'm sure The Duchess will chop off my head!\nNarrator: Alice guessed he was looking for the gloves and fan that he had dropped - but she didn't know where they were either. After all her growing and shrinking, Alice was exactly the same size as the rabbit. When the White Rabbit saw Alice, he spoke to her quite angrily.\nWhite Rabbit: Mary Ann! What are you doing out here? Run home this minute and get me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quickly!\nAlice: How surprised he'll be when he finds out I'm not Mary Ann!\nNarrator\nAlice began to run, as the White Rabbit had told her, although she didn't quite know where she should run to. But soon, a little house appeared with the words 'W. Rabbit' written on the door.\nAlice: I won't knock on the door. The real Mary Ann might hear me.\nNarrator: Alice crept into the house and went quietly upstairs to a little bedroom… and there she found two fans, three pairs of gloves and…\nAlice: Another bottle! I hope it makes me grow bigger again. I'm tired of being such a tiny little thing!\nNarrator: …and sure enough, Alice began to grow. Taller and taller she grew, until…\nAlice: Ouch! My head! That's quite tall enough. That's tall enough! O-o-o-oh…\nNarrator: Alice tried her hardest to stop growing - but it seemed to her like the harder she tried, the taller she grew. Soon Alice was so big that she filled the whole room. Her head pressed up against the ceiling, her arm went out of the window, and one of her feet went up the chimney.\nAlice: What will become of me now?\nNarrator: Outside the house, a crowd started to gather. Alice heard voices.\nVoices: Oh my, whatever could it be? What’s that?\nNarrator: Soon, the White Rabbit arrived.\nWhite Rabbit: What's that in the window?\nVoice: It's an arm, sir!\nWhite Rabbit: An arm? Well, it's got no business being there! Bill! Bill! Fetch the ladder and take it away!\nNarrator: Bill was the gardener. He brought a ladder and climbed up on to the roof.\nWhite Rabbit: I won't have an arm in my bedroom! Down you go Bill, down the chimney!\nNarrator: Poor Bill went up the ladder and tried to go down the chimney. But Alice's foot was waiting for him… with a big kick.\nBill: Ohhhhhhhh!!!!\nVoices: Quick, quick, help him, help him up. Give him some air…\nAlice: There! That's got rid of him! Now what will they try?\nVoices: Cakes! Cakes! Try the cakes!\nWhite Rabbit: Yes! The cakes: bring the cakes! We'll need a lot of them. That's right. Now, everybody, throw them through the other window!\nAlice: What's this…? Oh! Lots and lots of little cakes.  I wonder… If I ate them, would I shrink again? They must do something… and I must get out of this house. I'll try just one of them to start with.\nNarrator: Alice ate one of the little cakes, and soon found herself to be a little smaller. She ate another and another, until at last she was just the right size to run out of the bedroom… and out of the house.\nVoices: Look! There she is! Get her! Catch her, quickly!\nNarrator: But Alice was too fast for them. She ran far away from the White Rabbit's house, deeper and deeper into the forest until she became quite lost. She was wondering what she could eat or drink to make her grow to the right size again, when suddenly, she saw in front of her a large mushroom - about the same size as herself, with a large blue caterpillar sitting on top of it, smoking a pipe and taking no notice of Alice at all. Will the caterpillar help Alice to grow again? I'll tell you next time.",

		"text"		: "Narrator: After Alice frightened everyone by growing as big as a house, she ate some little cakes and shrank again. She doesn't like being so tiny, so she's looking for something to make her grow to the right size. But this is Wonderland and what she finds, sitting on top of a mushroom, is very curious indeed…\nAlice: Am I as small as a mushroom, or is the mushroom as tall as me? Ohh!!\nNarrator: Sitting on top of the mushroom was a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah pipe.\nCaterpillar: Who are you?\nAlice: I… I'm not sure. I know who I was when I woke up this morning. But I've changed so many times since then!\nCaterpillar: What do you mean by that? Explain yourself!\nAlice: I can't explain myself because I'm not myself. It's very confusing… I think you should tell me who YOU are first.\nCaterpillar: Why?\nAlice: Ummm…\nNarrator: Alice couldn't think of any good reason. She decided to leave.\nCaterpillar: Come back! I have something important to say!\nAlice: Yes? \nCaterpillar: Don't be unhappy.\nAlice: Is that all?\nCaterpillar: No. So you think you've changed, do you?\nAlice: I have, sir. I don't stay the same size for more than ten minutes!\nCaterpillar: What size do you want to be?\nAlice: Oh, I don't mind. A little bit bigger is all I would like. Seven centimetres is such a terrible height!\nCaterpillar: It is a very good height! I myself am exactly seven centimetres in height!\nNarrator: And with that, the caterpillar crawled off the mushroom and away.\nCaterpillar: One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter. Seven centimetres indeed!\nAlice: Hmmm… let me pull this side… and now this side…But which side is which?\nNarrator: There was only one way to find out the answer to that question. Alice took a bite of one piece of the mushroom - and shrank so quickly that she hit her chin on her foot.\nAlice: Ouch!\nNarrator: Quickly, she ate some of the other piece of mushroom and …\nAlice: Where have my shoulders gone? And my hands – where are you, hands?\nNarrator: Alice grew and grew until her neck was as long as a snake. Up and up she grew, through the branches and leaves, until her head was higher than the trees. Alice found she could move her neck just like a snake, bending this way and that. She was about to use her long neck to push her head down into the trees and look for her shoulders and hands, when suddenly a furious bird flew at her.\nBird: Snake! Snake! You want my eggs! I know!\nAlice: I'm not a snake! I'm a… I'm a little girl!\nBird: Little girl or snake, it doesn't matter to me, you want my eggs just the same!\nAlice: I don't want your eggs, really I don't!\nBird: Then be off with you! Go away!\nNarrator: The bird settled angrily into its nest. Alice ate a little of one side of the mushroom, then a little of the other, then a little of the first again until she was a good size. She decided to find her way back to the door to the beautiful garden that she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. As she walked through the forest she found a little clearing, with a small house in it, not much more than a metre or so high.\nAlice: I wonder who lives here? The house is so small – anyone who lives here will surely be afraid of me!\nNarrator: Alice ate a little more of the mushroom and quickly brought herself down to the right size for this little house. Next time, Alice meets a walking fish, talks to a smiling cat and has to look after a baby. Goodbye.",

She's wondering who lives there.\nAlice: I wonder who could live in such a little house!\nNarrator: Before she had the chance to wonder for very long, a fish ran out of the woods and knocked on the door. The fish was wearing a footman's uniform. Another footman opened the door. Alice was near enough to hear what the fish said.\nFootman: From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\nAlice: The Duchess!!\nNarrator: Alice was so curious she went to knock on the door. But there was no use knocking, because it was so noisy inside the house that no-one could possibly hear her little knock. Alice was even more curious now so she opened the door…\nAlice: Hello?\nNarrator: And she found herself in a noisy, smoky kitchen. A cook was cooking a pan of soup over the fire and the Duchess was holding a crying baby. There was also a big cat who was sitting above the fire and smiling from ear to ear. Everyone was sneezing except the cook and the cat.\nAlice: There's too much pepper in that soup! Please would you tell me why your cat grins like that?\nThe Duchess: It's a Cheshire-Cat, and that's why.\nAlice: I didn't know Cheshire-Cats grinned. In fact, I didn't know cats could grin.\nThe Duchess: You don't know much, and that's a fact.\nNarrator: Just then, the cook took the pan of soup off the fire, and started throwing pots and pans and plates and dishes all around the kitchen. Some of them hit the Duchess, but she didn't seem to notice. Some of them hit the baby, who was crying anyway.\nAlice: Oh please! The baby! Be careful!\nThe Duchess: Here! You hold it if you like!\nNarrator: And the Duchess threw the baby at Alice who just managed to catch it.\nAlice: Ohhh!!\nThe Duchess: I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.\nNarrator: And, with that, The Duchess left. Alice held the baby and wondered what to do with it.\nAlice: What am I going to do with you? You're a strange shape… Oh! You're a not a baby. You're a… you're a pig!\nNarrator: It was easy to decide what to do with a pig. Alice took it outside and let it go into the woods. The Cheshire-Cat sat in a tree and watched her.\nAlice: Cheshire-Cat, could you tell me which way I should go?\nCheshire-Cat: A Hatter lives over here, and a March Hare lives over there. They're both mad.\nAlice: But I don't want to meet mad people.\nCheshire-Cat: Oh, we're all mad here. Are you playing croquet with the Queen today?\nAlice: I'd love to play croquet with the Queen… but she hasn't invited me.\nCheshire-Cat: You'll see me there…\nNarrator: The cat disappeared. Alice set off in the direction of the March Hare's house and soon she came to a house. Outside the house she saw a tea-party quite unlike any tea-party she had ever seen before. Next time, I'll tell you all about the Tea Party and what happened when Alice met the March Hare and the Hatter. Goodbye.",

One lump or two?\nAlice: Curiouser and curiouser. They're having a tea-party. But where are all the guests?\nNarrator: The Hatter and the March Hare were sitting at one end of a very long table, which had empty cups and plates all the way along it.

I'm sorry, no room!\nAlice: There's plenty of room!\nNarrator: Alice sat down. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide.\nHatter: Why is a raven like a writing desk?\nAlice: Ooh, good. Riddles!

At least, I mean what I say. That's the same thing, isn't it?\nHatter: But why is a raven like a writing-desk? Have you guessed the answer yet?\nAlice: No. I give up.

Do you know?\nMarch Hare: I don't know either!\nAlice: I think you should only ask riddles if you know the answer.\nMarch Hare: Have some more tea.\nAlice: I haven't had any tea, have I? So I can't take more.\nHatter: You mean you can't take less. It's very easy to take more than nothing.\nNarrator: Alice got up and walked off without saying goodbye.\nMarch Hare: More tea, Hatter?\nHatter: Don't mind if I do!\nNarrator: The Hatter and the March Hare didn't seem to notice her leaving. Alice went back into the woods. She looked back as she walked away. The Hatter and the March Hare were trying to put the mouse into the teapot.\nHatter and Hare: Mousey mousey! In you go! Plop! Oh, he does wriggle so. More tea?\nAlice: I'll never go there again! That was the stupidest tea-party I've ever been to in all my life!\nNarrator: Back in the woods, Alice saw a tree with a door in it.\nAlice: That's very curious! I wonder what could be behind a door in a tree...\nNarrator: In Wonderland anything can be behind any door. Alice opened the door and there she was at the beginning of her adventures again – in the hall with the locked doors and the table with the little key on it.\nAlice: I remember that little door and the key! This time I know what to do! I'm finally going to get into the garden!\nNarrator: Alice had learned a lot about growing and shrinking in Wonderland. She took the key off the table first… and then ate some of the mushroom she had taken from the caterpillar and put in her pocket. Soon she was small enough to unlock the door and go through it.\nAlice: Oh, it's so pretty here!\nNarrator: We'll leave Alice here for now, happy in the garden at last.

		"text"		: "Narrator: Hello! After all her adventures, Alice has finally found the beautiful garden she's been looking for all this time. It's full of beautiful white roses. Alice wandered through the flowers until she saw a gardener. He was doing something very strange...\nAlice: Why are you painting the roses red?\nGardener: The Queen - she wants red roses and I put white roses in by mistake. If the Queen finds them, she'll cut my head off! Oh no! Here comes the Queen!\nNarrator: The gardener threw himself to the ground and lay with his face down. A line of soldiers and courtiers came marching into the rose garden. They didn't look like people at all. They looked exactly like playing cards: their bodies were square and flat with their heads at the top and their hands and feet in the four corners. First came a group of ten soldiers, who were decorated with black clubs, then came ten of the Queen's servants, who were covered in red diamonds. Then came all the princes and princesses, wearing red hearts. The Knave of Hearts was carrying a crown on a cushion, and last of all came the King and Queen of Hearts. When they got to Alice, everybody stopped. The Queen looked at Alice.\nQueen: Who is this?\nAlice: I'm Alice, Your Majesty.\nQueen: Can you play croquet?\nAlice: Yes!\nQueen: Come on then! Everyone get to your places!\nAnimals: I'm over here... Are you over there? This is place, no this is your place, are we ready?\nNarrator: Everyone began running in different directions until they got into place and the game began. It was a very curious game: everything seemed to be alive! The balls were hedgehogs and the croquet mallets were flamingos. All the playing-card-soldiers bent over so they looked like arches. The players had to catch the flamingos first, which wasn't easy because they kept flying away. When the flamingos were caught, each player held their flamingo tightly under one arm, with the long neck and head hanging down to the ground. Then the hedgehogs curled up into spiky balls – and the players used the flamingos' heads to hit the hedgehogs so that they rolled through the playing-card soldier arches.\nAnimals: Is it my turn? Oh good shot! Have another go... oh do stand still! Very nicely played, it's your turn again, very good, etc...\nAlice: What a curious game! I suppose I should play.\nNarrator: It was a very curious game! There didn't seem to be any rules. Everyone played at the same time and the hedgehogs kept running away. Alice took a flamingo and tried to hit a hedgehog with it. But the flamingo moved its head and she missed. Soon the players began arguing and fighting for the hedgehogs and the Queen went around stamping her feet and shouting at everyone.\nQueen: Off with your head! Off with her head!\nAnimals: No it isn't your turn! That's my ball, give me my hedgehog! It's my turn, not yours! Is that my flamingo? That's cheating!\nAlice: How will I get out of here?\nNarrator: As Alice was looking around for a way to escape, suddenly the Cheshire-Cat appeared in the air. He wasn't sitting on anything, he was just floating.\nCheshire-Cat: Are you enjoying the croquet?\nAlice: No. I don't think they play fairly at all. Everyone is arguing and there aren't any rules.\nCheshire-Cat: How do you like the Queen?\nAlice: Not at all! I suppose I should try to play or she might cut off my head!\nNarrator: Alice went to find her hedgehog. She found it having a fight with another one. While she was trying to pull the two animals apart, her flamingo flew away.\nAlice: Oh dear! I'm not doing very well at this game. What will the Queen think?\nNarrator: Alice was right to worry. Most of the other players had made the Queen angry for one reason or another and the soldiers took them away one by one. Soon there were only the King, the Queen and Alice left in the game. The Queen turned to Alice.\nQueen: You! Come here! Who were you talking to?\nAlice: If you please, your Majesty...\nVoice: The trial is starting! The trial is starting!\nQueen: The trial! Oh good! I love trials! Come along!\nNarrator: Alice had no choice but to follow the Queen. We'll leave her there for now. Next time. I'll tell you all about the Knave of Hearts, the stolen jam tarts and what happened when Alice met the Hatter and The White Rabbit again. Goodbye.",

I didn't do it!\nKing: Silence! Call the first witness!\nWhite Rabbit: Bring in the first witness!\nNarrator: The first witness was the Hatter. He looked very nervous. He came into the court with a cup of tea in one shaking hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other.\nKing: Give your evidence Hatter, and don't be nervous, or you'll lose your head!\nNarrator: The King's words made the Hatter even more frightened. He was so confused and that he took a large bite out of his teacup instead of his bread and butter.\nHatter: I'm a poor man, your Majesty.\nKing: You're a very poor speaker.\nWhite Rabbit: Poor Hatter. He didn't use to be mad, you know. He used to be quite normal.\nAlice: And I used to be taller…\nNarrator: Alice began to have a curious feeling. It was a feeling she remembered.\nAlice: Ohh.. I'm growing again!\nNarrator: No-one noticed that Alice was getting taller. They were all watching the Hatter, who was too frightened to speak.\nKing: You may go. Call the next witness!\nNarrator: The next witness was the cook.\nKing: Cook, what are tarts made of?\nCook: Pepper, mostly.\nNarrator: Everybody started sneezing. Nobody seemed to notice Alice growing taller and taller. By the time they stopped sneezing, the cook had disappeared.\nKing: Never mind!

Imagine her surprise when he straightened up, took a deep breath and shouted the name of the next witness…\nWhite Rabbit: Alice!\nNarrator: Everybody in the courtroom turned to look at Alice. Alice felt herself grow a little taller, as she took a deep breath, and stepped forward.

		"title"		: "Alice's evidence",
		"text"		: "Narrator: Hello. Alice has had lots of adventures in Wonderland. Now, she has been called as a witness in the trial of the Knave of Hearts. The King of Hearts is the judge, but Alice has grown so tall that her head reaches the top of the courthouse and all the people seem very far away.\nAlice: How small you all are!\nKing: The witness must come to the witness box!\nNarrator: Alice jumped up and knocked over the jury box. It was full of animals and they all fell out.\nAnimals: Ooh, ow, oh are you hurt? Excuse me, is that my chair? Etc...\nAlice: I'm so sorry!\nKing: What do you know about this business?\nAlice: Nothing at all!\nNarrator: The King looked in his Book of Rules.\nKing: Rule forty-two. \"All persons more than a mile high must leave the court.\"\nAlice: I'm not a mile high!\nKing: Indeed you are not! You are nearly two miles high!\nAlice: Well, I'm not going! And you can't make me!\nNarrator: Alice had grown a little bit more, and the King, who was now the size of Alice's shoe, could see she was right about that part. His face went very pale and he closed his Book of Rules.\nKing: White Rabbit. Ask the jury: what is their decision about this matter? Did the Knave steal the Queen's tarts?\nNarrator: But there was more evidence. The White Rabbit gave a letter to the King, who opened it and turned to the Knave of Hearts.\nKing: Knave of Hearts, did you write this?\nKnave of Hearts: I didn't write it! Look at the end of it: there is no name written there!\nKing: Then you are not a honest man! An honest man always signs his work! Read the letter!\nNarrator: And the White Rabbit read the letter. No-one understood a single word of it.\nKing: That's the most important evidence we've heard today!\nAlice: I don't believe there's any meaning in it!\nKing: If there's no meaning in it, then we don't need to try to find any! Jury, what is your decision?\nNarrator: The Queen stamped her feet.\nQueen: No, no no! Punishment first, decision afterwards!\nAlice: That's nonsense! The punishment comes last!\nQueen: Be quiet!\nAlice: I won't!\nQueen: Off with her head!\nNarrator: No-one moved. Alice realised she had grown to her full size.\nAlice: Who cares about you? All of you!\nNarrator: Alice looked down at the little people all around her. She suddenly realised…\nAlice: You're nothing but a pack of cards!\nNarrator: As soon as she said this, the animals, the birds, the King and Queen and everyone else turned into a pack of cards and they all flew up into the air and came flying down upon her. The cards fluttered and flew all around her head and shoulders and Alice gave a scream as she tried to beat them off with her hands…\nAlice: Ohhhh!!\nNarrator: And then another strange thing happened to Alice. She found herself back on the riverbank where our story began. She opened her eyes and saw her sister smiling at her.\nAlice's sister: Wake up, Alice dear! What a long sleep you've had!\nNarrator: Alice's sister gently brushed away some dead leaves that had fallen from the tree and onto her face.\nAlice: Oh… I've had such a curious dream. There was a White Rabbit and … I got bigger and smaller … and I met a caterpillar and a Hatter … and played croquet and … a cat that smiled and … so many things.\nNarrator: Alice told her sister all about the Wonderland in her dream and the adventures she had had there. Perhaps one day Alice will dream herself back to Wonderland. If she does, I'll be sure to tell you. Goodbye.",
