		"text"		: "Narrator: Algernon Moncrieff, a wealthy young man from the upper classes of society, is passing the time playing the piano in his luxurious flat in central London. He's waiting for his aunt and cousin to come to tea. Algernon is a well-dressed and pleasant-looking man. His servant, Lane, is busy preparing the table.\nAlgernon: Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?\nLane: I thought it would be rude to listen, sir.\nAlgernon: Oh, that's a pity. Now, have you made the cucumber sandwiches yet for Lady Bracknell? They said they would be here at five.\nLane: Yes, sir. Here they are.\nAlgernon: Oh! Good… By the way, Lane, I noticed eight bottles of champagne were drunk on Thursday night while I was having dinner with Mr Worthing.\nLane: That's correct, sir.\nAlgernon: Why do bachelors' servants always drink their champagne?\nLane: It's probably because a bachelor's wine is better than the wine you'd find in married families.\nAlgernon: Good heavens! Is marriage as bad as that?\nLane: People tell me that it is very pleasant, sir. I don't have much experience. I've only been married once.\n(a bell rings)\nAlgernon: Aha! That will be my dear aunt, Lady Bracknell… Tell her that I'm in the morning room.\nNarrator: But it isn't Algernon's aunt. It's a young gentleman who follows Lane into the room. He's good-looking and has a serious expression on his face. Algernon is pleased, though surprised, to see him.\nLane: Mr Ernest Worthing.\nAlgernon: How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you to London?\nJack: Oh, pleasure of course!\nAlgernon: Where have you been since last Thursday?\nJack: In the country.\nAlgernon: What on earth do you do there?\nJack: When you are in town you entertain yourself. When you are in the country you entertain other people. It is really quite boring.\nAlgernon: And who do you entertain?\nJack: Oh, neighbours.\nAlgernon: Got nice neighbours where you live in Shropshire?\nJack: Perfectly horrid! Never speak to any of them.\nAlgernon: They must find you very entertaining, then!\nJack: Hello! Why all these cups? Why cucumber sandwiches? Who's coming to tea?\nAlgernon: Oh! Just my aunt Lady Bracknell and… her daughter Gwendolen…\nJack: How wonderful!\nAlgernon: Yes, but Lady Bracknell won't approve of you being here.\nJack: Why not?\nAlgernon: My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful. It's almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.\nJack: I'm in love with Gwendolen. I've come to London to ask her to marry me.\nAlgernon: You told me you had come here for pleasure? I call that business.\nJack: You are so unromantic!\nAlgernon: I really don't see anything romantic in proposing. It's very romantic to be in love. But there's nothing romantic about asking someone to marry you. They may accept you. Then the excitement is all over. If I ever get married, I'll certainly try to forget that I am.\nJack: I'm sure you will, dear Algy.\nAlgernon: I don't think you will ever marry Gwendolen.\nJack: Why on earth do you say that?\nAlgernon: Well, in the first place, girls never marry the men they flirt with.\nJack: Oh, that's nonsense!\nAlgernon: It's true. It explains why there are so many bachelors. In the second place, I won't give you my permission.\nJack: Your permission?\nAlgernon: My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin, and before I allow you to marry her, you will have to explain about… Cecily.\nJack: Cecily? What do you mean? Who is Cecily? I don't know any one called Cecily.\n(A bell rings)\nLane: You called, sir?\nAlgernon: Bring me that cigarette case Mr Worthing left here last Thursday.\nLane: Yes, sir.\nJack: Have you had my cigarette case all this time? I wish you'd told me. I've been to the police. I nearly offered a large reward.\nAlgernon: Well, I wish you would. I'm quite hard up at the moment.\nJack: There's no point offering a large reward now it's been found.\nLane: The cigarette case, sir.\nAlgernon: I think that's rather mean of you, Ernest. However, it's not important now because according to the inscription inside, the case isn't yours anyway.\nJack: Of course it's mine. You've seen me use it hundreds of times. Now, could I have my cigarette case back?\nAlgernon: Yes, but this isn't your cigarette case. It's a present from someone called Cecily, and you said you didn't know anyone of that name.\nJack: Well, actually, Cecily is my aunt.\nAlgernon: Your aunt!\nJack: Yes. Lovely old lady she is, too. Lives in Tunbridge Wells.\nAlgernon: But why does she call herself \"little Cecily\" if she is your aunt? \"From little Cecily with her fondest love.\"\nJack: What's wrong with that? Some aunts are tall, some are small.\nAlgernon: Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? \"From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.\" There is no problem, I admit, to an aunt being small, but why should an aunt call her own nephew… uncle? Besides, your name isn't Jack. It's Ernest.\nJack: It isn't Ernest. It's Jack.\nAlgernon: You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to everyone as Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life – so honest and serious.\nNarrator: Ah yes, we should just say that the name Ernest was very common at the time, and the adjective 'earnest' – which sounds exactly the same - means, well, honest and serious.\nAlgernon: Here, it's written on your card: \"Mr Ernest Worthing, B4, The Albany.\"\nJack: Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.\nAlgernon: Yes, but that doesn't explain why your small Aunt Cecily calls you her dear uncle. Or why you have two names to start with. Come on, you'll have to explain.",

		"title"		: "The Proposal",
		"text"		: "Narrator: Algernon has just asked his good friend Jack to explain why he calls himself Jack in the country but Ernest in London. Jack says it's because he is the guardian of a girl called Cecily, who lives with him in the country. She looks up to him and he feels he should behave well when he's with her, so he pretends he has a younger brother called Ernest so that when he comes up to London, he can enjoy himself.\nJack: That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth.\nAlgernon: So, Ernest, you are a Bunburyist!\nJack: What on earth do you mean?\nAlgernon: You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, so that you can come to London as often as you like. I have invented a sick friend called Bunbury so that I can go to the country whenever I like. Bunbury is invaluable. For example, if Bunbury didn't have such bad health, I would have to have dinner with my aunt Lady Bracknell tonight. And I have no intention of doing that.\nJack: Why not?\nAlgernon: Well, to begin with, I had dinner with her on Monday - once a week is quite enough to eat with your own relations. Secondly, I know I will be seated next to Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband - most unpleasant! Besides, I want to have dinner with you and talk about Bunburyism.\nJack: I'm not a... Bunburyist. In fact I think I am going to kill my brother Ernest. Cecily is a little too interested in him. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr... with your sick friend.\nAlgernon: I will not be separated from Bunbury...  (a bell rings) Ah! That must be my aunt now. Now, if I keep her busy for ten minutes so you can propose to Gwendolen, will you have dinner with me tonight?\nJack: Alright Algy...\nLane: Lady Augusta Bracknell and Miss Gwendolen Fairfax.\nNarrator: A well-dressed, elderly woman and her daughter, a pretty, young lady enter the room.\nLady Bracknell: Good afternoon, dear Algernon. Oh, hello, Mr Worthing.\nJack: Hello, Lady...\nLady Bracknell: Now, Algernon... I'd like a nice cup of tea, and one of those cucumber sandwiches you promised me.\nAlgernon: Certainly, Aunt Augusta. Good heavens! Lane! Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?\nLane: There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.  \nAlgernon: No cucumbers!\nLane: No, sir. \nAlgernon: I am very sorry, Aunt Augusta.\nLady Bracknell: It doesn't matter, Algernon. Pour me some tea.\nAlgernon: Here you are.\nLady Bracknell: Thank you. Now, Algernon, about tonight - you will be seated next to Mary Farquhar. \nAlgernon: I'm afraid, Aunt Augusta, I won't be able to have dinner with you tonight.\nLady Bracknell: But why not, Algernon?\nAlgernon: Well, I have just heard that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again. I'll have to go and see him.\nLady Bracknell: It's very strange. This Mr Bunbury seems to have curiously bad health. I think it is time that he made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. And I would be very grateful if you could ask Mr Bunbury to please not be ill on Saturday, because I need you to organise my music at my soirée.\nAlgernon: I'll speak to him, Aunt Augusta, and I'm sure he'll be well by Saturday. But why don't we go next door to look at the programme of music I've prepared.\nLady Bracknell: Thank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you.\nNarrator: Algernon and his aunt go into the music room, leaving Jack and Gwendolen alone.\nJack: It has been a lovely day, Miss Fairfax.\nGwendolen: Please don't talk to me about the weather, Mr Worthing. Whenever people talk about the weather, I am sure they mean something else. And that makes me nervous.\nJack: I do mean something else.\nGwendolen: I thought so. \nJack: Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you...\nGwendolen: Yes, I realised that. Actually, I have always been fascinated by you... even before we met.  \nJack: Really?\nGwendolen: Yes, I've always wanted to love someone called Ernest. That name inspires complete confidence. When Algernon first mentioned that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love you.\nJack: You really love me, Gwendolen?\nGwendolen: Passionately!\nJack: But you don't really mean that you couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest?\nGwendolen: But your name is Ernest.\nJack: Yes, I know. But what if it was something else? Do you mean you couldn't love me then? Personally, I don't think the name suits me.\nGwendolen: It suits you perfectly. \nJack: But there are lots of other much nicer names. Jack, for instance, is a charming name.\nGwendolen: Jack? Oh, no, Jack does not have the same sound at all. It's not exciting. The only really safe name is Ernest.\nJack: Gwendolen, I must get christened at once - I mean, we must get married at once.\nGwendolen: Married, Mr Worthing?\nJack: Well... surely. You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you felt the same.\nGwendolen: I adore you. But you haven't proposed to me yet. Nothing has been said at all about marriage.\nJack: Well... may I propose to you now?\nNarrator: And so Jack kneels down and asks Gwendolen to marry him. She accepts and Jack is still on his knees when Lady Bracknell returns.\nLady Bracknell: Mr Worthing! Do get up! \nGwendolen: Mamma! Please leave us. Mr Worthing has not quite finished yet.\nLady Bracknell: Finished what, may I ask?\nGwendolen: I am engaged to Mr Worthing, mamma. \nLady Bracknell: Pardon me, you are not engaged to anyone. When you do become engaged, I, or your father will tell you. A young girl should be surprised by an engagement, pleasantly or unpleasantly. It is not something that she is allowed to arrange for herself... And now I would like to ask you a few questions, Mr Worthing. Gwendolen, can you wait for me below in the carriage.\nGwendolen: Mamma!",

		"title"		: "Lost and found",
		"text"		: "Narrator: Jack has asked Gwendolen to marry him. She thinks his name is Ernest, her favourite name, and has happily accepted. But her mother, Lady Bracknell, is not pleased about the engagement. She wants to ask Jack some questions about his background and finances.\nLady Bracknell: Now, Mr Worthing, I am quite prepared to add your name to my list of eligible young men for my daughter if you answer my questions in a suitable way... Do you smoke?\nJack: Well, yes, I do.\nLady Bracknell: I'm glad to hear it. How old are you?\nJack: Twenty-nine.\nLady Bracknell  : The best age to be married in my opinion. What is your income?\nJack: Between seven and eight thousand a year.\nLady Bracknell  : Seven and eight thousand. Do you own a house?\nJack: Well, I have a country house with some land.\nLady Bracknell: A country house! How many bedrooms? You have a town house, I hope? A girl like Gwendolen could not be expected to live in the country.\nJack: Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but I rent it to Lady Bloxham. \nLady Bracknell: Very well. Now to more minor subjects. Are your parents living?\nJack: I have lost both my parents.\nLady Bracknell  : To lose one parent, Mr Worthing, is unlucky; to lose both looks like carelessness. Who was your father?\nJack: I'm afraid I don't know. The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents. It would be more truthful to say that my parents lost me... I was... well, I was found.\nLady Bracknell: Found!\nJack: The late Mr Cardew, one of the kindest gentlemen I've ever met, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he happened to have a ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time. Worthing is in Sussex. It's the most delightful seaside resort... \nLady Bracknell: Where did this kind gentleman find you?\nJack: In a handbag.\nLady Bracknell: A handbag?\nJack: Yes, Lady Bracknell, I was in a handbag - a rather large, black handbag, with handles to it.\nLady Bracknell  : And where did Mr Cardew come across this ordinary handbag?\nJack: In the cloakroom at Victoria Station. It was given to him by mistake instead of his own.\nLady Bracknell: The cloakroom at Victoria Station?\nJack: Yes. \nLady Bracknell: Mr Worthing, I have to say I feel rather confused by what you have just told me. To start life in a bag, whether it had handles or not, shows a lack of respect for family life. As for the bag being found in a cloakroom at a railway station, that isn't the best way to begin a successful life in society today.\nJack: May I ask you then what I should do? I would do anything to ensure Gwendolen's happiness.\nLady Bracknell: I would strongly advise you, Mr Worthing, to acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to try to produce at least one parent.\nJack: Well, I don't see how I can do that. I can produce the bag now. It's at home. That should be enough for you, surely, Lady Bracknell.\nLady Bracknell: Mr Worthing! You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would allow our only daughter to marry into a cloakroom, and form an alliance with a parcel? Goodbye, Mr Worthing!\nJack: Goodbye! \nAlgernon: How did it go? Oh, didn't it go well, old boy? Did Gwendolen refuse you? \nJack: Oh, as far as Gwendolen is concerned, we are engaged. Her mother, though, is perfectly unbearable. She's a monster... I beg your pardon, Algy, I shouldn't talk about your aunt in that way in front of you.\nAlgernon: My dear boy, I love people being rude about my relations. It's the only thing that makes me put up with them.\nJack: You don't think Gwendolen could become like her mother, do you, Algy?\nAlgernon: Gwendolen is the most sensible, intellectual girl I know. But all women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. By the way, did you tell Gwendolen about being Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?\nJack: My dear fellow, the truth isn't the sort of thing you tell a nice, sweet girl.\nAlgernon: What about your brother? What about Ernest?\nJack: Oh, I shall have finished with him by the weekend. I'll say he died in Paris from a severe cold.\nAlgernon: But I thought you said that... Cecily was interested in Ernest? Won't she be very sad?\nJack: Oh, that's all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say. She has got a good appetite, goes on long walks, and pays little attention to her lessons.\nAlgernon: I would like to see Cecily.\nJack: I will take very good care you never do. She is very pretty, and she is only just eighteen.\nAlgernon: Have you told Gwendolen about Cecily?\nJack: Oh! Cecily and Gwendolen are certain to be extremely good friends. Half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other 'sister'.\nAlgernon: Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first. Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis's for dinner, we must go. It's nearly seven.\nNarrator: Just then, Gwendolen comes in and tells Jack that she will always love him, even if they don't get married. She asks him for his address in the country, and Algernon - listening quietly - secretly writes it down. Jack takes Gwendolen to her carriage and Algernon is left on his own, with a smile on his face.\n(A bell rings)\nLane: You called, sir.\nAlgernon: Tomorrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.\nLane: Yes, sir.\nAlgernon: I'm going to Hertfordshire. I shall probably not be back until Monday. You can prepare all my Bunbury clothes.\nLane: Yes, sir. \nAlgernon: I hope tomorrow will be a fine day, Lane.\nLane: It never is, sir.\nAlgernon: Lane, you are a perfect pessimist.\nLane: I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.",

		"title"		: "A visit from Ernest",
		"text"		: "Narrator: Algernon secretly managed to find out the address of Jack's house in the country – the house where he lives with Cecily. We now join Cecily, a pretty girl of eighteen, and her governess Miss Prism – that's the lady who looks after her, in their garden on a summer's day. They're studying German grammar, but Cecily seems more interested in the flowers.\nMiss Prism: Cecily! Leave the flowers. Sit down and we'll look at the German verbs.\nCecily: But I really don't like German.\nMiss Prism: Cecily, you know Mr Worthing wants you to improve yourself.\nCecily: Dear Uncle Jack is so serious!\nMiss Prism: Cecily! I am surprised at you. You know the problems Mr Worthing has. You must remember how worried he is about his unfortunate young brother.\nCecily: I wish Uncle Jack would let that unfortunate young man, his brother, come here sometimes. Oh, Miss Prism… Look who's coming… It's Reverend Chasuble.\nNarrator: And indeed, they hadn't noticed the middle-aged man walking up the garden because they had been talking so energetically about Jack.\nMiss Prism: Reverend Chasuble! This is a pleasure.\nChasuble: Oh, Miss Prism, I hope you are well?\nCecily: Miss Prism has just been complaining of a headache. I think it would be good for her to have a short walk with you in the park, Reverend.\nMiss Prism: I haven't mentioned anything about a headache.\nCecily: No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I thought you had been looking like you might get one.\nChasuble: Mr Worthing, I suppose, has not returned from London yet?\nMiss Prism: He won't be back until Monday afternoon.\nChasuble: Ah yes, he likes spending Sunday in London. He's not one of those people who spend all their time enjoying themselves, not like that young man his brother.\nMiss Prism: I think, dear Reverend, I will have a walk with you. I find I have a headache after all, and a walk might do it good.\nChasuble: With pleasure, Miss Prism.\nMiss Prism: Cecily, you can read your economics book while I'm gone. \nNarrator: So Miss Prism and Dr Chasuble wander off, leaving Cecily alone. She immediately shuts her book on economics and is about to get up when Merriman, the butler, arrives.\nMerriman: Mr Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station.\nCecily: Uncle Jack's brother! Did you tell him Mr Worthing was in London?\nMerriman: Yes, Miss. He seemed very disappointed. He had been hoping to find Mr Worthing at home and had been planning to stay the night. I mentioned that you and Miss Prism were in the garden. He said he would like to talk to you for a moment.\nCecily: Ask him to come here.\nMerriman: Yes, Miss.\nCecily: I have never met a really wicked person before.\nNarrator: Algernon enters looking stylish and confident.\nAlgernon: You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure.\nCecily: You are mistaken. I am not little. In fact, I believe I am unusually tall for my age. \nAlgernon: Oh, I'm sorry…\nCecily: But I am your cousin Cecily. You are Uncle Jack's brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.\nAlgernon: Oh! I'm not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.\nCecily: If you aren't, then you have been deceiving us all. I hope you haven't been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. \nAlgernon: Oh! Of course I have been rather reckless.\nCecily: I am glad to hear it.\nAlgernon: In fact, now you mention it, I've been very bad in my own small way.\nCecily: I don't think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it has been very pleasant.\nAlgernon: It is much pleasanter being here with you.\nCecily: I can't understand why you are here at all. Uncle Jack isn't back until Monday afternoon.\nAlgernon: How disappointing! I have to go back to London early on Monday morning. \nCecily: Well, I think you should wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know he wants to speak to you about you emigrating.\nAlgernon: About me what?\nCecily: You emigrating. He's gone to London to buy you some clothes.\nAlgernon: I'm not happy about Jack buying my clothes. I don't like his style of ties at all.\nCecily: I don't think you'll need ties. Uncle Jack is sending you to Australia.\nAlgernon: Australia! I'd sooner die.\nCecily: Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to choose between this world, the next world, and Australia.\nAlgernon: Oh, well! I haven't heard very good things about Australia or the next world. This world is good enough for me, cousin Cecily.\nCecily: Yes, but are you good enough for it?\nAlgernon: I'm afraid I'm not. That is why you have to reform me, cousin Cecily.\nCecily: I'm sorry, I don't have time this morning.\nAlgernon: Well, will you have time to reform me this afternoon?\nCecily: I think you should try.\nAlgernon: I will, but I will need a little something to eat first. I'm a little hungry.\nCecily: How thoughtless of me! Won't you come in for something to eat?\nAlgernon: Thank you. Could I have one of your flowers first? \nCecily: Certainly.\nAlgernon: I'd like a pink rose.\nCecily: Why? \nAlgernon: Because you are like a pink rose, cousin Cecily.\nCecily: I don't think it can be right for you to talk to me like that. Miss Prism never says such things to me.\nAlgernon: Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady. You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.\nNarrator: Algernon and Cecily go up to the house. Miss Prism and Reverend Chasuble, who had been walking and discussing the advantages of marriage for single men, also return home. But someone else is now walking up the garden path. It's Jack! He's back early. He's dressed in black and looking very serious.\nMiss Prism: Mr Worthing! This is indeed a surprise. We thought you were coming back on Monday!\nChasuble: Dear Mr Worthing, I hope this black suit does not mean some terrible news?\nJack: My brother.\nMiss Prism: Spending lots of money and running up debts again?\nChasuble: Still leading his life of pleasure?\nJack: Dead!\nChasuble: Your brother Ernest, dead?\nJack: Quite dead.",

What they don't know is that Algernon is at the house at this very moment, pretending to be Ernest.\nChasuble: I am very sorry about your brother, Mr Worthing. I shall, of course, mention this tragic event in my sermon next Sunday. \nJack: That would be most kind, Reverend.\nChasuble : I can usually adapt my weekly sermon to almost any occasion, happy or sad – weddings, christenings...\nJack: Christenings... Ah! That reminds me, Reverend Chasuble. I suppose you do know how to christen? \nChasuble: Well...\nJack  : I mean, of course, you often christen people, don't you?\nChasuble  : But which baby do you want to christen, Mr Worthing? Your brother wasn't married, was he?\nJack: Oh no. But it's not for a child, Reverend. No! It's me - I'd like to be christened... this afternoon.\nChasuble: But surely you have been christened already?\nJack: I don't remember anything about it.\nChasuble  : Well, what time would you like the ceremony performed?\nJack: Oh, around five if that would suit you?\nChasuble: Perfectly!\nNarrator: Just at this time, Cecily comes out of the house into the garden.\nCecily: Uncle Jack! Oh, I am pleased to see you back. But why are you wearing those awful clothes?\nMiss Prism: Cecily!\nCecily: Oh! What's the matter, Uncle Jack? You look so sad, and I've got such a surprise for you. Who do you think is in the dining room? Your brother!\nJack: Who?\nCecily: Your brother Ernest. He arrived about half an hour ago.\nJack: But I haven't got a brother.\nCecily: Oh, don't say that. However badly he may have behaved to you in the past, he is still your brother. I'll tell him to come out. You will shake hands with him, won't you, Uncle Jack? \n[Cecily leaves]\nChasuble: This is happy news...\nJack: My brother here? That's quite absurd.\nNarrator: Cecily comes out of the house again, this time holding Algernon's hand.  \nJack: Good heavens! \nAlgernon: Brother Jack, I've come to tell you that I'm very sorry for all the trouble I've given you, and that I plan to lead a better life in the future.\nNarrator: Jack can't believe his eyes and stares at his friend. Algernon puts out his hand, but Jack ignores it.\nCecily: Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse to shake your own brother's hand?\nJack: Nothing will make me shake his hand. I think him coming down here is disgraceful. He knows perfectly well why.\nCecily: Uncle Jack, do be nice. There is some good in everyone. Ernest has just been telling me about his poor sick friend Mr Bunbury whom he often visits. And there must certainly be a lot of good in someone who is kind to a sick friend.\nJack: Oh! He's been talking about Bunbury, has he?\nCecily: Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr Bunbury, and how ill he is.\nJack: Bunbury! Well, I won't let him talk to you about Bunbury or about anything else. \nAlgernon: Of course I admit that I have not behaved well, but I expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially as it's the first time I have come here.\nCecily: Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I'll never forgive you.\nJack: Never forgive me?\nCecily: Never!\nJack: Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it... There!\nChasuble: I think we should leave the two brothers together.\nMiss Prism: Cecily, you will come with us.\nNarrator: And so they all go off leaving the men alone. Jack tells Algernon he must leave immediately, but just then, the butler, Merriman, arrives.\nMerriman: I have put Mr Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir. I suppose that is all right?\nJack: What?\nMerriman: Mr Ernest's luggage, sir.\nJack: His luggage?\nMerriman: Yes, sir. \nJack: Merriman, order the carriage at once. Mr Ernest has been suddenly called back to London.\nMerriman: Yes, sir. \nAlgernon: What a terrible liar you are, Jack. I have not been called back to London at all.\nJack: Yes, you have.\nAlgernon: Well, I have to say, Cecily is lovely.\nJack: You are not allowed to talk of Miss Cardew like that. I don't like it.\nAlgernon: Well, I don't like your clothes. Why don't you go and change? It is perfectly childish to be in mourning for a man who is actually staying in your house as a guest. \nJack: You are certainly not staying with me as a guest or anything else. You are leaving... by the four-five train.\nAlgernon: Well, I won't leave you while you are in mourning. It would be most unkind. If I was in mourning, I think it would be very unkind if you didn't stay with me.\nJack: Well, will you leave if I change my clothes?\nAlgernon: Yes, if you are not too long. I've never known anyone take so long to get dressed and with such little result.\nJack: Well, it's better than always being over-dressed as you are.\nAlgernon: If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by always being immensely over-educated.\nJack: Your vanity is ridiculous and your behaviour is an outrage. You have got to catch the four-five back to London. This Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.\nNarrator: Jack leaves.\nAlgernon: [To himself] I think it has been a great success. I'm in love with Cecily. I must see her before I go. Ah, there she is watering the flowers.\nCecily: Oh, I just came back to water the roses. I thought you were with Uncle Jack.\nAlgernon: He's gone to order the carriage for me.\nCecily: Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?\nAlgernon: He's going to send me away.\nCecily: Then have we got to say goodbye?\nAlgernon: I'm afraid so. It's a very painful parting.\nCecily: It's always painful to part from people you have only just met. It's easy to be apart from old friends for a long time. But being apart for just a short period from someone you have just been introduced to is almost unbearable.\nAlgernon: Thank you.\nMerriman: The carriage is at the door, sir.",

		"text"		: "Narrator: Jack is not happy that Algernon has come to his house pretending to be his younger brother Ernest. And he's really not happy that Algernon has met Cecily, telling him to go back to London immediately. Jack has also asked Reverend Chasuble to christen him with a different name. Let's now join Algernon and Cecily in the garden.\nAlgernon: I hope you won't mind, Cecily, if I tell you quite truthfully that you seem to me to be in every way absolutely perfect.\nCecily : I admire your honesty, Ernest. Now, can I just write down what you are saying in my diary. [Writing in diary] ev... er... y... way... abs...\nAlgernon: Do you really keep a diary? I'd love to have a look. May I?\nCecily  : Oh no. You see, it's just a young girl's record of her own thoughts, so I can publish them. But, Ernest, please, don't stop talking. I love doing dictation. I have reached 'absolutely perfect'. Go on...\nAlgernon: Ahem! Ahem!\nCecily: Oh, don't cough, Ernest. I don't know how to spell a cough. \nAlgernon: The truth is, Cecily, ever since I first saw you, I have loved you wildly, passionately and hopelessly.\nCecily: [Writing] Wildly... passionately... Oh, I don't think that you should tell me that you love me wildly, passionately and hopelessly. Hopelessly doesn't make much sense, does it?\nNarrator: Here comes the butler, Merriman, again...\nMerriman: The carriage is waiting, sir.\nAlgernon: Tell it to come back next week.\nCecily: Uncle Jack would be very annoyed if he knew you were staying till next week.\nAlgernon: Oh, I don't care about Jack. I only care about you. I love you, Cecily. You will marry me, won't you?\nCecily: What a question! Of course, silly! Well, we have been engaged for the last three months.\nAlgernon: For the last three months?\nCecily: Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.\nAlgernon: But how did we become engaged?\nCecily: Well, ever since Uncle Jack told us that he had a wicked younger brother, you have been the main topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism. And a man who is talked about a lot is always very attractive. I fell in love with you, Ernest.\nAlgernon: Darling! And when did we actually get engaged?\nCecily: On the 14th of February. I got tired of the fact you didn't know I existed, and so, after a long struggle with myself, I decided to accept you under this dear old oak tree here. Here are all your letters in this box. Look...\nNarrator: And my goodness... There's a whole bundle of letters neatly tied up with a blue ribbon.\nAlgernon: My letters! But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any letters.\nCecily: You don't need to remind me, Ernest. I had to write your letters for you. I wrote three times a week, and sometimes more often.\nAlgernon: Oh, do let me read them, Cecily.\nCecily: Oh, no. They would make you far too conceited. The three you wrote after I had broken off the engagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelt, that even now I can hardly read them without crying a little.\nAlgernon: But did we break off our engagement?\nCecily: Of course we did. On the 22nd of March. Look I'll read about it to you. [Reading from diary] 'Today I broke off my engagement with Ernest. I think it is the best thing to do. The weather is still lovely.'\nAlgernon: But why on earth did you break it off? What had I done? I had done nothing at all. Cecily, I am very hurt to hear you broke it off. Particularly when the weather was so lovely.\nCecily: It wouldn't have been a really serious engagement if it hadn't been broken off at least once. But I forgave you very quickly.\nAlgernon : What an angel you are, Cecily!\nCecily: You dear romantic boy.\nAlgernon: You'll never end our engagement again, will you Cecily?\nCecily: Not now that I have actually met you. Besides, of course, there is the question of your name.\nAlgernon: Yes, of course. \nCecily: You mustn't laugh at me, but it had always been a girlish dream of mine to love someone whose name was Ernest. That name inspires complete confidence. \nAlgernon: But, Cecily, do you mean that you could not love me if I had a different name?\nCecily: But what name?\nAlgernon: Oh, any name you like - Algernon - for instance...\nCecily: But I don't like the name Algernon. I might respect you, Ernest, but I don't think I'd be able to really love you.\nAlgernon: Ahem! Cecily! The Reverend is, I suppose, knows how to carry out all church ceremonies?\nCecily: Oh, yes. Reverend Chasuble is a very clever man. He has never written a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.\nAlgernon: I must see him at once on a most important christening - I mean on important business.\nCecily: Oh!\nAlgernon: I won't be away more than half an hour.\nCecily: Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that I only met you today for the first time, I think it's rather hard that you should leave me for so long. Couldn't you make it 20 minutes?\nAlgernon: [He kisses her] I'll be back in no time.\nNarrator: Merriman arrives to announce the arrival of a visitor.\nMerriman: A Miss Fairfax is here to see Mr Worthing. On very important business, Miss Fairfax says.\nCecily: Isn't Mr Worthing in the library?\nMerriman: Mr Worthing went to see Reverend Chasuble some time ago.\nCecily: Please ask the lady to come out here. Mr Worthing will be back soon, I'm sure. And you can bring tea.\nMerriman: Yes, Miss.\nCecily: Miss Fairfax! I suppose one of the many elderly women who are associated with Uncle Jack in some of his goodwork in London.\nNarrator: But it's not an elderly woman who follows Merriman into the garden. What a surprise! It's Gwendolen!",

		"text"		: "Narrator: Algernon and Cecily are engaged. But Cecily thinks his name is Ernest and so Algernon has rushed off to change his name. Meanwhile, Gwendolen has arrived and is about to meet Cecily for the first time. Gwendolen also thinks she's engaged to someone called Ernest.\nCecily: Hello, my name is Cecily Cardew.\nGwendolen: What a sweet name! I like you already. I think we are going to be great friends. My first impressions of people are never wrong.\nCecily: How nice of you to like me so much when we have only just met. Please sit down.\nGwendolen: May I call you Cecily?\nCecily: With pleasure!\nGwendolen: And you can call me Gwendolen… You are here on a short visit, I suppose.\nCecily: Oh no! I live here.\nGwendolen: Really? Your mother, no doubt, lives here, too?\nCecily: Oh no! I don't have a mother or father - in fact, I don't have any relations.\nGwendolen: Really?\nCecily: My dear guardian looks after me.\nGwendolen: Your guardian?\nCecily: Yes, Mr Worthing.\nNarrator: She means Jack, of course.\nGwendolen: Oh! That's strange - he's never mentioned to me that he was a guardian. And I'm not sure, that this news fills me with great delight... I have liked you ever since I met you, Cecily. But now that I know that Mr Worthing is your guardian, I can't help wishing that you were... well… just a little older, and not quite so... well... attractive. In fact, if I may speak honestly...\nCecily: Please do...\nGwendolen: Well, to be honest, Cecily, I wish that you were 42 and unattractive. Ernest would never lie to me. Though I don't always trust him, [to herself] especially with beautiful women.\nCecily: I'm sorry, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?\nGwendolen: Yes.\nCecily: Oh, but it isn't Mr Ernest Worthing who is my guardian. It's his brother - his elder brother.\nNarrator: By Ernest Worthing, she means Algernon.\nGwendolen: Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a brother.\nCecily: Well, they haven't been getting along well for a long time.\nGwendolen: Ah! that explains it. Cecily, you have greatly reassured me. I was beginning to get anxious. You are quite sure that it is not Mr Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?\nCecily: Quite sure. In fact, I am going to be his.\nGwendolen:  I beg your pardon?\nCecily:  Dearest Gwendolen Mr Ernest Worthing and I are going to get married.\nNarrator: Now when Cecily says Ernest here, she, of course, means Algernon, who she thinks is called Ernest.\nGwendolen: My darling Cecily, there must be some mistake. Mr Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.\nNarrator: And when Gwendolen says Ernest here, she, of course, means Jack.\nGwendolen: The announcement will appear in the paperon Saturday.\nCecily:  You must be mistaken. Ernest proposed to me ten minutes ago. I've written it in my diary.\nGwendolen: That's very strange, because he asked me marry him yesterday afternoon. Here, it's in my diary. I never travel without my diary. You should always have something excitingto read in the train. I'm sorry, dear Cecily, but I'm afraid he was mine first.\nCecily: It upsets me, dear Gwendolen, but I have to point out that since Ernest proposed to you, he has clearly changed his mind.\nGwendolen: If the poor fellow has been trapped I intend to rescue him at once.\nCecily : Whatever entanglement my dear boy has got into, I will never blame him.\nGwendolen: Are you referring to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement? \nCecily: Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I trapped Ernest into an engagement? How dare you? \nGwendolen: Miss Cardew…\nMerriman :  Ahem!\nNarrator: But they are interrupted by Merriman who arrives with the tea. The two women look angrily at each other. They can't continue their argument in front of him.\nGwendolen:  Are there many interesting walks around here, Miss Cardew?\nCecily: Oh! Yes! Several. From the top of the hills you can see five counties.\nGwendolen: Five counties! I wouldn't like that; I hate crowds.\nCecily:  I suppose that is why you live in London? \nGwendolen:  Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.\nCecily: So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.\nGwendolen: I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.\nCecily: Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London. Would you like some tea, Miss Fairfax?\nGwendolen:  Thank you. \n Awful girl! \nCecily:  Sugar?\nGwendolen: [Superciliously] No, thank you. Sugar is not fashionable any more.\nNarrator: Cecily puts four lumps of sugar into the cup, which she gives to Gwendolen, who does not notice as she is short-sighted.\nCecily: [Severely] Cake or bread and butter?\nGwendolen: Bread and butter, please. Cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.\nNarrator: Cecily cuts a large slice of cake and hands it to Gwendolen. Gwendolen drinks the tea and shudders. She puts down the cup, reaches out for the bread and butter and finds it's cake.\nGwendolen: You have put sugar in my tea, and though I asked quite clearly for bread and butter, you have given me cake. I usually have a gentle and sweet nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.\nCecily: I would do anything to save my poor, innocent boy from the secret plansof another girl.\nGwendolen: From the moment I saw you I distrusted you. My first impressions of people are always right.\nCecily: It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am wasting your valuable time. \nNarrator: And here comes Jack.\nGwendolen: Ernest! My own Ernest!\nJack: Gwendolen! Darling! \nGwendolen: [Draws back] Wait! May I ask if you are engaged to this young lady? \nJack:  To dear little Cecily! Of course not! \nGwendolen: Thank you. \nCecily:   I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss Fairfax. This gentleman is my guardian, Mr Jack Worthing.\nGwendolen: I beg your pardon?\nCecily: This is Uncle Jack.\nGwendolen: Jack! Oh! \nNarrator: And now Algernon arrives, too.\nCecily: Here is Ernest.\nAlgernon: Cecily, my love! \nCecily: Wait, Ernest! May I ask you - are you engaged to this young lady?",

		"text"		: "Narrator: Cecily and Gwendolen both thought they were engaged to someone called Ernest. But Gwendolen has just found out her man's real name is Jack. Let's join them in the garden now, where Cecily is asking Algernon an important question...\nCecily: Are you engaged to Gwendolen?\nAlgernon: Engaged to Gwendolen? Of course not! What made you think that?\nCecily: Thank you. \nNarrator: And Cecily lets Algernon kiss her on her cheek.\nGwendolen: I knew there was some slight error, Miss Cardew. The gentleman who is now embracing you is my cousin, Mr Algernon Moncrieff.\nCecily: Algernon! Is your name Algernon?\nAlgernon: I cannot deny it.\nCecily: Oh!\nGwendolen: Is your name really Jack?\nJack: My name certainly is Jack. It's been Jack for years.\nCecily: Gwendolen, we have both been greatly deceived.\nGwendolen: My poor Cecily!\nCecily: My sweet Gwendolen!\nJack and Algernon : [groan]\nGwendolen: Mr Worthing, there is just one question I would like to ask you. Where is your brother Ernest? Cecily and I are both engaged to be married to your brother, so it is a matter of some importance to us to know where he is at present.\nJack: Gwendolen, Cecily, it is very painfulfor me to speak the truth and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However, I will tell you quite frankly that I don't have a brother Ernest. I don't have a brother at all. I've never had a brother in my life, and I don't plan to ever have one in the future.\nCecily: No brother at all?\nJack: None!\nGwendolen: Have you never had a brother of any kind?\nJack: Never. Not even of any kind.\nGwendolen: Cecily, it's quite clear that neither of us are engaged to be married to anyone.\nCecily: It's not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find herself in. Is it?\nGwendolen: Let's go in the house. They'll dare not come after us there.\nCecily: No, men are so cowardly, aren't they?\nNarrator: And the two women, who minutes before were arguing, now go arm in arm into the house.\nJack: This awful situation is what you call Bunburying, I suppose?\nAlgernon: Yes, and a wonderful Bunbury it is. \nJack: Well, you've no right to Bunbury here.\nAlgernon: That's absurd. People can Bunbury anywhere they choose. Every serious Bunburyist knows that.\nJack: Serious Bunburyist! Good heavens!\nAlgernon: Well, you have to be serious about something.\nJack: Well, the only satisfaction I have in all this terrible business is that your friend Bunbury is finished. You won't be able to run to the country quite as often as you used to, dear Algy. \nAlgernon: Your brother is a little unwell, isn't he, dear Jack? You won't be able to disappear to London quite so frequently now. \nJack: As for your behaviour towards Miss Cardew, I must say that fooling a sweet, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable. To say nothing of the fact that I am her guardian.\nAlgernon: I can see no excuse at all for you deceiving a clever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin.\nJack: I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all. I love her.\nAlgernon: Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily. I adore her.\nJack: There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.\nAlgernon: And I don't think it's very likely, Jack, that you and Miss Fairfax will be together. Ooh... muffins...\nJack: Well, that's no business of yours... And how can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble? You seem perfectly heartless.\nAlgernon : [eating] Well, I can't eat muffins in a nervous way. The butter would probably get on my sleeves. You should always eat muffins quite calmly. It's the only way to eat them.\nJack : Well, that's no reason to eat them all in that greedy way. Give them to me.\nAlgernon: But you just said it was heartless to eat muffins.\nJack: Algy, I wish you would go.\nAlgernon: You can't possibly ask me to go without having some dinner. Besides I have just arranged with Reverend Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six with the name of Ernest.\nJack: My dear fellow, please stop that nonsense. I arranged this morning with Reverend Chasuble to be christened myself at 5.30, and I will, of course, take the name of Ernest. We can't both be called Ernest. Besides, I have a perfect right to be christened if I like. There is no evidence at all that I have ever been christened by anybody. You, on the other hand, have already been christened.\nAlgernon: Yes, but I haven't been christened for years.\nJack: Yes, but you have been christened. That's the important thing.\nAlgernon: Yes, so I know I can stand it. You're not quite sure that you have ever been christened, and I think it would be rather dangerous to do it now. It might make you very unwell.\nJack: [eating] Oh, that's nonsense; you are always talking nonsense.\nAlgernon: Jack, you're eating the muffins again! I wish you wouldn't. There are only two left. I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.\nJack: Algernon! I have already told you to go. I don't want you here. \nAlgernon: I haven't quite finished my tea yet! And there is still one muffin left. \nJack: [groans in despair]",

The men come in trying to look and sound cheerful.\nJack and Algernon: [whistling Daisy, Daisy]\nGwendolen: I'm sure they're feeling sorry. Let's not say anything.\nCecily: Certainly not. Mr Moncrieff, why did you pretend to be my guardian's brother?\nAlgernon: So that I had the opportunity to meet you.\nCecily: That seems a satisfactory explanation, doesn't it Gwendolen?\nGwendolen: Yes, if you can believe him.\nCecily: I don't. But his answer was so beautiful.\nGwendolen: True. In matters of great importance, it's style, not truth that is essential. Mr Worthing, why did you pretend to have a brother? Was it so you could come to London to see me?\nJack: Do you have any doubts, dear Gwendolen?\nGwendolen: I have serious doubts. But I intend to ignore them. Cecily, should we forgive them?\nCecily: Yes. I mean no. Probably not. What about their names?\nGwendolen: True! I had forgotten!\nGwendolen and Cecily: Your names are still a huge problem!\nJack and Algernon: Our names! Is that all? But we are going to be christened with a different name this afternoon.\nGwendolen: You are prepared to do this terrible thing for me, Jack?\nJack: I am.\nCecily: To please me you are ready to face this awful experience, Algernon?\nAlgernon: I am!\nGwendolen: How can people talk about the equality of the sexes! Men have moments of physical courage which we women know absolutely nothing about.\nCecily: Jack, darling!\nAlgernon: Cecily, darling! \nNarrator: And they fall into each other's arms. Merriman comes in and coughs loudly. He announces a visitor.\nMerriman: Ahem! Ahem! Lady Bracknell!\nJack: Good heavens!\nLady Bracknell: Gwendolen! What does this mean?\nGwendolen: Simply that I am engaged to Mr Worthing, mamma.\nLady Bracknell: Mr Worthing, I followed my daughter by train. Gwendolen is meant to be attending a university lecture. Well, that is what her father thinks. All communication between yourself and my daughter must end immediately. \nJack: We are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell!\nLady Bracknell: You are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, what about Algernon! … Algernon!\nAlgernon: Yes, Aunt Augusta.\nLady Bracknell: May I ask if it is in this house that your sick friend Mr Bunbury lives?\nAlgernon: Oh! No! Bunbury doesn't live here. Bunbury is somewhere else at the moment. In fact, Bunbury is dead.\nLady Bracknell: Dead! When did he die? \nAlgernon: Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon.\nLady Bracknell: He died so suddenly? What did he die of?\nAlgernon: I mean he was discovered! The doctors discovered that he could not live, so he died.\nLady Bracknell: He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his doctors. I am glad that he finally made up his mind to take some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. And now, Mr Worthing, who is the young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is holding in an unnecessary way?\nJack: That is Miss Cecily Cardew, I'm her guardian. \nAlgernon: I am engaged to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.\nLady Bracknell: I beg your pardon?\nCecily: Mr Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.\nNarrator: Lady Bracknell has to sit down at this news.\nLady Bracknell: There seems to be something unusually exciting in the air – the number of engagements seems to be above average. Mr Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected with any railway stations in London? I am simply asking. Until yesterday I didn't know any families or people whose origin was a station.\nJack: Miss Cecily Cardew is the granddaughter of the late Mr Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square; Gervase Park, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire.\nLady Bracknell: Three addresses. That always gives me confidence. I am not unsatisfied.\nJack: How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell! \nLady Bracknell: Now Gwendolen, we have to leave… Just one thing, Mr Worthing, does Miss Cardew have any money?\nJack: Oh! About £130,000. That is all. Goodbye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you.\nLady Bracknell: A moment, Mr Worthing. £130,000! Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her. Come over here, dear… Turn round, dear child, so I can see your face.There are definite social possibilities in your face. Algernon!\nAlgernon: Yes, Aunt Augusta!\nLady Bracknell: There are definite social possibilities in Miss Cardew.\nAlgernon: I don't care about social possibilities.\nLady Bracknell: Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can't get into it do that. Now Miss Cardew, of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon. But I do not approve of marriages for money. Well, I suppose I must give my consent.\nAlgernon: Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\nLady Bracknell: The marriage had better take place quite soon. I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the chance to find out each other's characters before marriage – never a good thing.\nJack: I'm sorry to interrupt you, Lady Bracknell, but I am Miss Cardew's guardian, and I don't give my consent to this marriage.\nLady Bracknell: And why not may I ask? Isn't Algernon an extremely eligible young man? He has nothing, but he looks everything. What more can one desire?\nJack: The fact is that I do not approve of his moral character. He has not been honest. \nNarrator: Algernon and Cecily look at him amazed.\nLady Bracknell: Untruthful! Algernon? Impossible! \nJack: I'm afraid there is no doubt. This afternoon he came to my house pretending to be my brother. He has succeeded in one afternoon to change the affections of dear Cecily. He then stayed to tea, and ate all the muffins. \nLady Bracknell: Ahem! Mr Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided to forgive my nephew's behaviour.\nJack: That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell. However I have not changed my mind. I do not give my consent.",

		"text"		: "Narrator: Lady Bracknell is visiting Jack's house in the country. She won't allow Jack to marry Gwendolen, and Jack, who is Cecily's guardian, won't allow Cecily to marry Algernon.\nLady Bracknell: Come here, dear child. How old are you?\nCecily: Eighteen.\nLady Bracknell: Well, you'll soon be able to decide yourself who to marry. \nJack: Excuse me, Lady Bracknell, but Miss Cardew doesn't come of age until she is 35, only then can she marry who she likes.\nLady Bracknell: Oh, that's not a problem. Thirty-five is a very attractive age. London society is full of women who have remained 35 for years. Lady Dumbleton, for example, she's been 35 ever since she turned 40, a long time ago. \nCecily: But I can't wait that long. I hate waiting even five minutes for someone. Waiting, even to be married, is just not possible.\nAlgernon: Well, what shall we do, Cecily?\nCecily: I don't know, Algernon.\nLady Bracknell: My dear Mr Worthing, as Miss Cardew says she cannot wait till she is 35 – which seems to indicate she is a little impatient – could you change your mind?\nJack: My dear Lady Bracknell, the moment you agree to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will happily allow your nephew to become engaged to Cecily.\nLady Bracknell: That is impossible. Look at the time! Gwendolen, dear, we've already missed five trains. \nNarrator: But they'll miss the next one, too, because Reverend Chasuble arrives to announce that everything is ready for the christenings.\nLady Bracknell: Christenings, sir! Isn't that a little premature?\nChasuble: Both these gentlemen have said they want to be christened this afternoon.\nLady Bracknell: At their age? That's ridiculous! Algernon, Lord Bracknell would be very unhappy if he knew this was how you wasted your time and money.\nChasuble: So, no christenings this afternoon?\nJack: It would be no use to either of us, Reverend Chasuble, at the moment.\nChasuble: Well, I'll return to the church straight away. It seems Miss Prism has been waiting there for me for an hour and a half.\nLady Bracknell: Miss Prism! Did you say Miss Prism?\nChasuble: Yes, Lady Bracknell. I'm going to see her now.\nLady Bracknell: Wait a moment. Is this Miss Prism an unattractive woman, connected with education?\nChasuble: She's very well educated indeed.\nLady Bracknell: It's obviously the same person. And what position does she have in your house?\nJack: Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, is Miss Cardew's governess.\nLady Bracknell: I must see her at once.\nChasuble: Well, she's here now! Look, she's coming up the garden path.\nNarrator: Miss Prism arrives. When she sees Lady Bracknell, she goes white.\nLady Bracknell: Prism! Come here! Where is that baby? Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left my house with a pram in which a male baby was sleeping. You never came back. The police found the pram.It contained a novel but no baby! Prism! What happened to that baby? \nMiss Prism: Lady Bracknell, I really don't know. I wish I did. This is what happened. I took the baby out in its pram as usual. I also took with me a large, old handbag in which I was intending to put the novel that I had written. In a moment when I wasn't thinking, I put the novel in the pram, and placed the baby in the bag.\nJack: But where did you put the bag?\nMiss Prism: I left it in the cloakroom of a railway station in London.\nJack: Which railway station?\nMiss Prism: Victoria. \nJack: I must just go to my room. \nNarrator: He rushes off. After several minutes, Jack returns carrying a black leather bag.\nJack: Is this the bag, Miss Prism?\nMiss Prism: Yes, here are my initials. I'm so pleased to get it back so unexpectedly. It has been very inconvenient not to have it all these years.\nJack: Miss Prism, it's not just the bag that has been given back to you. I was the baby in it.\nMiss Prism: You?\nJack: Yes… mother!\nMiss Prism: Mr Worthing, there is some mistake! Lady Bracknell can tell you who you really are.\nJack: Lady Bracknell, I hate to be inquisitive, but could you tell me who I am?\nLady Bracknell: I'm afraid you are the son of my poor sister, Mrs Moncrieff. You are Algernon's elder brother.\nJack: Algy's elder brother! Then I do have a brother. I always said I had a brother! Algy, you'll have to treat me with more respect in future. You have never behaved like a brother to me.\nAlgernon: I did my best.\nGwendolen: My darling! But what is your christian name, now that you have become someone else?\nJack: Good heavens! I had forgotten about that. Lady Bracknell, when Miss Prism left me in the bag, had I been christened already?\nLady Bracknell: Your parents gave you everything, including a christening.\nJack: Well, what name was I given? \nLady Bracknell: You were the eldest son, so you were given your father's name.\nJack: Yes, but what was his name?\nLady Bracknell: I cannot remember the General's full name. \nJack: Algy! Can't you remember what our father's name was?\nAlgernon: My dear fellow, I was one when he died.\nJack: His name would appear in the army lists, wouldn't it, Lady Bracknell?\nLady Bracknell: That's true.\nJack: I have the lists of the last 40 years here. \nNarrator: He rushes to the bookcase and pulls the books out. \nJack: Generals… Mallam, Migsby, Moncrieff! General 1869, his full name was… Jack Ernest! … I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I? Well, it is Ernest after all. \nGwendolen: Ernest! My own Ernest! I felt from the beginning that you could have no other name!\nJack: Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to suddenly find out that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you forgive me?\nGwendolen: I can. For I'm sure you will change.\nJack: My darling!\nNarrator: And Jack embraces Gwendolen. Algernon does the same with Cecily. Even Reverend Chasuble embraces someone – Miss Prism, much to her delight.\nJack: Gwendolen! At last!\nLady Bracknell: My nephew, you are showing a lack of seriousness.\nJack: No, it's the opposite, Lady Bracknell. I've now realised for the first time in my life the extreme Importance of Being Earnest.",
