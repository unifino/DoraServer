		"text"		: "Phil: Hello, I'm Phil. I live in London. My apartment is close to the Houses of Parliament and I can hear the bells of Big Ben chiming every hour. I live on bus route number 88 which is handy because it takes me to my office in Oxford Circus. What do I do? Well, I'm an author – I write books – but don't worry if you haven't heard of me, my books never sell – ever. In fact I want a career change because I desperately need some money. When I pay all my bills, you see, I only have enough spare money to buy a few drinks at my local pub – The Horse and Groom. That reminds me – I've got to go there now to meet some friends. Excuse me, we'll speak again soon.\nAT THE PUB\nJohn: Hello Phil. Late again!\nEmily: Hello Phil. How is your writing going?\nPhil: You know. It's all in my head not on paper.\nTom: Hi Phil, mate, how are you? We were just talking about travelling – Emily here, says she's climbed up Mount Everest! Rather extreme backpacking, don't you think?!\nEmily: I did do it. Five years ago. So come on John, what amazing thing have you done?\nJohn: Oh, I just went cycling across South America!\nEmily: You didn't!!\nJohn: I did. In my gap year. It was such a brilliant time. Four months on the road, although I did get a bit tired.\nTom: Sounds great. Did I ever tell you that I sailed across the Atlantic to America in a yacht I built with my own hands? I still have that yacht down at the docks – but I never use it now. How about you Phil – when did you have your big life adventure?\nPhil: Oh me? I haven't done much really. I'm not really one for adventure.\nEmily: Why not?\nPhil: Err… I never had any money - and where would I go?\nJohn: Come on, you need some adventure in your life. Don't you feel like doing some globetrotting?\nTom: Hey! I've got an idea!\nPhil: Tom has come up with a crazy idea where I could make some money and have some adventure. He has offered to lend me his yacht to sail around the world! Yeah – mad isn't it?! He thinks I could write about my adventures and make some money from it. But… I'm not someone who takes risks and I can definitely think of some problems…\nPhil: Slight problem… I can't sail.\nTom: No problem. There's an app you can download. It'll show you everything.\nPhil: An app? I'll need more than that. I've never sailed a yacht in my life.\nTom: It's easy! And how about if I give you the boat – I'll never use it again - you can sell it when you get back. It'll earn you a fortune, on top of the money you get from your travel writing.\nPhil: I couldn't possibly keep your yacht. You might want to use it again one day.\nTom: Hmmm yes, that's true.\nJohn: I know. Why don't you make it into a challenge?\nTom: Yes, John! Great idea. I'll tell you what – I'll make you a bet.\nPhil: A bet – for money – what is it?\nTom: Do you remember that story by Jules Verne – when that guy, Phileas Fogg had to travel around the world in 80 days?\nPhil: Yes.\nTom: Well, you've got to do it in 80 days. I bet you the boat that you won't do it. If you don't do it, I'll keep the boat. If you do sail around the world in 80 days, then you can keep the boat – and you can sell it if you want. He'll never do it!\nPhil: Hold on. How much have you had to drink? You want me to sail around the world, on my own, in 80 days?! Impossible.\nTom: I know. But if you want an adventure – and you want to keep the yacht – then that's the challenge. Exactly 80 days to sail all the way around the world – not a minute longer.\nEmily: Go on Phil, it'll be brilliant. Here, have another drink…\nJohn: Yes, and have my drink too.\nPhil: What should I do? It is true I need an adventure but this one is huge. I know, I'll have a few more drinks and think about it…\nPhil: OK. Yes - I accept the challenge!",

		"text"		: "Phil: Hello again. It's Phil here. You may know that I've been set a challenge to sail around the world in 80 days – it's an impossible challenge especially as I have never sailed a yacht before. But I said 'yes' – so here it goes... \nTom: So, here we at Saint Catherine's Dock and look – here's my yacht – The Mermaid - I know she's a bit scruffy but I'm sure she'll get you round the world…\nPhil: Hmm, on my own! That's the bit that worries me. It's a very small boat.\nTom: It's a yacht – not a boat – look: it's got a sail! Anyway, you'll be fine. Just call me on the satellite phone if you have any problems.\nPP: Hello, hi. Phil. Phil! It's me.\nPhil: Pete, what are you doing here?\nPhil: Pete is my office assistant: He makes the tea, he does the photocopying, he sometimes gives me ideas for my books. He's a great guy – so I'm really pleased to see him now…\nPP: Tom posted a message on Facebook that you're going on a trip round the world, or something. I couldn't believe my eyes – so I had to come here and see for myself. Look, I've brought you some books to read… and a map – you'll find that useful.\nPhil: I will… but what I really need is a travelling companion… someone who can help me on my journey… someone like you?! How about it?\nPP: No. Absolutely not. I can't. I've got to… errr… feed the cat.\nTom: I'll feed your cat. Go on. Can't you see he needs your help!\nPP: I get seasick…\nPhil: Rubbish! I remember when you went sailing with your Dad – you were always fine.\nPP: That was different. We were sailing on a lake.\nPhil: Well, you know about sails and rope and anchors – you'd be great. Besides, if you come with me you can have a share of the money.\nTom: If you get home in 80 days!\nPhil: I'm pleased to report that Pete is joining me. I'm so pleased I have someone to 'show me the ropes', as it were – in other words, show me what to do. He's a good friend, a loyal assistant and he goes everywhere with me so I'm giving him the nickname 'Passepartout', just like in the original book, Around the World in Eighty Days – I hope he likes it!\nPhil: We've set sail. Our adventure has begun. Let me describe the yacht to you. It is 12 metres long. It has a huge mast, with the mainsail attached. There is an engine as well just in case there's no wind. The wooden deck has seating at the stern – that's the back.There are some steps down to the galley – that's the kitchen – and there are two berths or beds for us to sleep in. I can't believe we're going to live in this tiny space for 80 days!\nPP: Phil, we've got the wind in our sails, we're making good progress. I can't even see land any more.\nPhil: Yes. Thanks to you, it's plain sailing! So, what does this rope do?\nPP: It moves the jib – the sail at the front.\nPhil: And this one?\nPP: That moves the boom from side to side. No, no. But don't pull it until…\nPhil: Ouch! That hurt.\nPhil: Day 5 and I'm learning how to sail but my best skills are in the galley, making tea. The weather is good but we seem to have a problem with the yacht…\nPhil: Passepartout, is it me or is it getting a bit wet down in the galley?\nPP: Let me have a look. Oh dear! There's water all over the floor. I think the boat is leaking.\nPhil: What? What are we going to do?\nPP: Drown!\nPhil: What? Really? I'm going to get on the radio and call for help… Mayday! Mayday! Oh no. The radio isn't working. We're in big trouble!\nPP: Be quiet. Calm down Phil. The radio isn't turned on – and we don't need to abandon ship just yet. I need to know where this water is coming from. It's only a slow leak but I think we need to fix it quickly. We need to head for dry land.\nPhil: According to the map the nearest land is some islands at 16 degrees north, 24 degrees west. Do you know where that is? Let's hope we get there before we sink.",

		"text"		: "Phil: Day 7 – we're in the Cape Verde islands and, no, we didn't sink! We have made it to port. There was a small hole in the tanks that store our drinking water and someone is now fixing it. But I'm glad we stopped here– the islands here are like another world – green, lush, warm and sunny – not like the concrete jungle we left at home. Unfortunately, we can't stay here for long – we are in a race after all, around the world. There's just time to take a 'selfie' to send back to my friends (click) – oh and I must just log on and check my emails…\nPhil: So there's an email from John who says… he hopes our trip is going well… and to remind me, that as part of the challenge, I have to bring back some rare, unusual souvenirs – and he wants a recording of some traditional music. Hmmm, what could that be?\nPP: Phil, everything is fixed. I've filled up with drinking water. It didn't cost much and the chap who fixed it gave me this CD – something for us to listen to on the yacht.\nPhil: What is it?\nPP: I don't know. It's just a CD of the local Morna music.\nPhil: What does it sound like?\nPP: He said it's a bit like blues music. Have a listen.\nPhil: That's brilliant Passepartout! What would I do without you?!\nPhil: Day 10 – and I'm out in the Atlantic Ocean – and what a big ocean it is when you look at it from our small yacht, The Mermaid. It is miles and miles of blue and grey water with nothing to see on the horizon. But we've got a good tail wind and we seem to be making good progress. Passepartout is at the wheel, steering our yacht to our next destination – St Helena. I'm helping out by making tea…\nPhil : Cup of tea, Passepartout?\nPP : More tea! OK then, it will help me concentrate. The sea is getting quite rough and I need your help up here on deck… \nRADIO MESSAGE:: Attention all shipping. A deep depression is forming in the South Atlantic, moving north. Severe gale force 11 winds are expected with heavy rain. Visibility will be poor.\nPP: Strong wind. Heavy rain. Sounds nasty. We're going to have to change direction. Get your waterproof clothes on – we're in for a wet and bumpy ride…\nPhil: The weather is already getting bad. The wind is very strong and the rain is hammering down and stinging our faces. Not my favourite weather – I prefer the calm, warm, sunny type. But we have no choice – we need to find shelter. Passepartout says we should go to some islands at 0.3 degrees north, 6.6 degrees east. Where could that be? And will we make it before the storm gets us? This was a dream trip – and suddenly it’s like a nightmare\nPP: Phil what are you doing? Hold onto that rope. Don't let go or we'll lose the sail.\nPhil : OK. It's getting very dark. Do you know which way to go?\nPP : Yes – of course I do – we do have a satellite navigation system. According to this, we're not too far from the coast – but I can't see anything.\nPhil\nLook! I can see lights of Sao Tome. Is that a lighthouse? Is it a harbour?\nPP : Yes. I think it is… but I don't know how we're going to land in these stormy seas. We're just going to hit the rocks.\nPhil : Hey look! There's someone on the harbour wall waving their arms. Let's get closer… Is it a mermaid?\nPP: A mermaid? She has legs.\nSophia: Over here. Quick! Throw me the rope.\nPhil : Phew. What luck! We're on dry land, safe from the storm and it’s all thanks to the help of a woman who lives on the island. She's invited us to her house to dry off and warm up. But are we in the right place?\nPhil : Thanks so much for helping us – you saved our boat – and our lives.\nSophia : My name is Sophia. I'm happy to have helped. Here you are – try some bobofrito and a cup of hot chocolate.\nPP : Mmm, nice. They taste like banana.\nSophia : That's what they are – bobofrito is banana fried in coconut oil. Do you like it?\nPhil : Do I like it? It’s amazing… just… let… me get some more… Mmmm…\nSophia : So tell me, what are you guys doing here?\nPP : We're sailing round the world but we needed to shelter from the storm. We were heading for St Helena… is that right, Phil?\nPhil : What? Oh yes, that's right. Sorry, I was enjoying this delicious hot chocolate. It tastes great too.\nSophia : It's made with our finest cacao beans. It's what Sao Tome and Principe is famous for.\nPhil : Cacao beans! That's great because they are one of the things I have to collect as part of my challenge. Can I take some with me?\nSophia : Your challenge?\nPP : Yes, we're sailing around the world from London back to London in 80 days. It's a stupid idea, isn't it?\nSophia : Hmm, well maybe not. Actually, you can have a bag of these beans if you can do me a favour?\nPhil : I'm sure we can help you. \nPhil : Sophia has told me she was also sailing around the world when she stopped in Sao Tome for a rest and ended up falling in love with a man who she then married. But her husband has started being cruel to her and she wants to leave the island and go home. Because she's got no money, she wants us to give her a lift back to Britain. The long way round! She is an experienced sailor, so how can we refuse? There is only one problem – we'll need to work out how she can escape without her husband noticing. This is exciting stuff!",

		"text"		: "Phil : Day 15 – we're in Sao Tome and trying to smuggle our new friend Sophia off the island and onto our boat. She wants to escape from her violent husband and return to her home in the UK. I'm always happy to help someone in distress and my reward for doing so is a bag of top quality cacao beans – something I have to collect as part of my challenge. But there's no time to hang around – I only have 65 days left to sail around the world, and I'm not sure if Passepartout wants an extra passenger…\nPP: Phil, I don't often complain but I'm not sure if we've got room for another passenger. I mean, have we got enough food? Where will she sleep? And can she sail?\nPhil: Keep your voice down… we can't leave her here – she's very upset. Sssh, look, here she comes. Sophia, over here… get inside this crate and we'll smuggle you onto the yacht. And if anyone asks us what we're doing, we can say we're loading up with supplies for our journey. In you get. Come on Passepartout, you can carry it; I'll keep a look out.\nPP: Thanks!\nPhil: Well, we did it. We now have a stowaway and despite Passepartout's doubts, Sophia seems to know about sailing because, like us, she was sailing around the world. I think it'll be fun having an extra person on board. I just hope Passepartout agrees…\nPP: Sophia – you need to let the sail out a bit more – loosen that rope…\nSophia: No, I don't think so. Wait until we 'go about' and then I'll do it; otherwise the wind will take us in the wrong direction.\nPhil: Ha ha Passepartout! I think you've met your match. Anyway, what's our best route from here?\nPP: We've got to go around the Cape of Good Hope. It's always a tricky bit of water. Plenty of ships have got caught in the strong currents and gone onto the rocks.\nSophia: If you allow me to steer, I can safely navigate us through these dangerous waters.\nPhil: I think that's a great idea – don't you Passepartout? I'll put the kettle on and make some tea.\nPhil: Day 22 – we've crossed the Equator and we're rounding the Cape of Good Hope. The sea is rough: the waves are like the huge hands of a monster trying to grab us. If we can get through this, we'll be out into the Indian Ocean and we will head for Indonesia. Sophia is doing a great job steering the yacht and Passepartout is busy looking after the ropes and sails. I'm downstairs in the galley writing this – I don't think I'm much help on deck you see. I'll see what our exact position is now on the satnav… oh, that's strange… the screen is blank… I can usually see where we are and our coordinates. What's wrong with it?\nPhil: Passepartout, the navigation system isn't working.\nPP: What? Let me have a look… Hmmm, very strange… everything else is working… let me just turn it on and… off again… that usually helps… No good.\nSophia: Is there a problem?\nPhil: We can't get the satnav to work – the screen is just blank. If we don't get it working again we're going to be lost at sea – we won't know where we're going.\nPP: I'll take a look at the fuse box. Phil, you need to help up on deck and… woooah…\nPhil: A huge wave has hit us. I'm ok, thankfully, but Passepartout has knocked his head badly. The satnav is broken and we're not sure what direction we're heading in. This is a bad, bad situation. If we go in the wrong direction we could lose days and we'll never win this race.\nSophia: Phil! Phil! I need your help. Passepartout is in a bad condition - look, he's got a huge cut on his head – he's bleeding badly. I need your help to keep us on course through these huge waves.\nPhil: OK. But we need to find land soon and get Passepartout to a hospital. But which direction do we go?\nSophia: Well, the sun always sets in the west – so that way must be east. And when it gets dark we can follow the stars. You steer that way and I'll sort out the sails. And Phil…\nPhil: … yes?\nSophia: You're doing really well.\nPhil: Oh… gosh, thanks.\nPhil: I'm beginning to like our new travelling companion. But I'm worried – we don't know where we're heading and Passepartout needs medical help. We've got to find land, but where? We're miles from anywhere. I'm beginning to wonder why I agreed to this stupid challenge. I've never missed home as much as now.",

		"text"		: "All: Wooah! Watch out!\nPhil: That was close.\nPhil: Day 35 - we've just missed being hit by a huge container ship. We're all so tired and we didn't see it coming. We've been at sea for several days and without our satellite navigation system it's hard to know which way we're going. Passepartout needs medical help and we have to get more food supplies. We must find land soon…\nSophia: Land ahoy!\nPhil: Land? Really? At last! Come on. Let's head for the harbour and find a hospital quickly.\nPassepartout: Oh, my head.\nPhil: We're on dry land. It's such a great feeling after just looking at endless water day after day. But where are we? People are speaking French and there's a wonderful smell of fresh coffee in the air. Anyway, we mustn’t waste any more time. Sophia is taking Passepartout to a hospital to see a doctor about the cut on his head. I have to get our satnav fixed and purchase some more supplies for the next leg of our journey. And I must take some photographs too to put on my travel blog. But wait a minute, I don't know where I am! Time for a walk I think…\nPhil: Excuse me young man – that coffee smells wonderful.\nMan: Oh this is Bourbon Pointu coffee. It's the best in the world and you can only get it here.\nPhil: And where is here?\nMan: Reunion Island.\nPhil: Reunion Island! So that's where we are. Goodness, we really have gone off course!\nMan: Where are you heading?\nPhil: We're supposed to be sailing around the world – but we got lost when our satnav broke.\nMan: Oh you don't have to worry about that, my brother fixes gadgets. I'm sure he can help. Let me take it for you and if you come back at 4 o'clock it will be ready. Hopefully!\nPhil: Brilliant. And while I'm here can I buy some of those beans?\nMan: Sure. Here, take some coffee beans as a present from me to you – and remember your visit to Reunion.\nPhil: I had to bring home some unique and special coffee beans as part of the challenge, so this is gift is perfect. But we have a long way to go; we mustn't waste any more time. I must get on with the shopping, wait for our satnav to be fixed and hope that Passepartout will be ok.\nSophia: Phil, Phil… we're back. Passepartout has got some stitches in his head. But I think he'll be fine…\nPassepartout: Oh will I? You're the expert now? Maybe if you leave me to sail our yacht we won't have any more little accidents?\nPhil: Come on Passepartout, let's all try to get on shall we? I know how useful you are – but Sophia got us safely through to Reunion. Come along – let's all be friends. OK?\nPassepartout: OK then. How's the satnav?\nPhil: It's fixed and it didn't cost much. Look, if I switch it on… I can tell you exactly where we are: 21 degrees south, 55 degrees east.\nSophia: Impressive!\nPhil: Yes, and look, I've got some special coffee to take home. Bourbon Pointu.\nSophia: Another one of your 'souvenirs'! Come on, we must get going – the weather forecast says there's a big storm coming and we have to avoid it.\nPhil: Yes, good idea. We can't waste any more time. Let's get back to the harbour. Passepartout, could you carry these bags of food please… they're… quite heavy.\nSophia: Isn't this where we left the yacht – between these two other boats?\nPassepartout: Are you sure Sophia? We did arrive in a rush.\nPhil: No, it was definitely here. In fact – look – these are our ropes. They've been cut. I don't believe it but I think our yacht has been stolen.\nPhil: Stolen! It couldn't get any worse. We're stuck halfway around the world with no yacht. There is no way we can get round the world in 80 days now. We've got to find our yacht – but where is it?",

Does this mean we're going to lose the race?\nPP: Well that's it then. We might as well give up and go home.\nPhil: We can't stop now – we're having so much fun. And anyway, we can't go home without our yacht. Oh look, there's that man who gave me the coffee beans. Maybe he can help…\nMan: Hello, how's the satnav now? All working?\nPhil: Well, err, yes – it's working, thank you very much. But we have another slight, little problem. We haven't got a yacht to put it on anymore.\nMan: Really?\nPhil: Yes, I'm afraid so. It looks like it's been stolen… you know, pinched… nicked.\nMan: Surely not. This sort of thing doesn't happen around here. It must be… pirates!\nSophia: Pirates! Real-life pirates?\nMan: Yes, they do exist but they’re not like the pirates in stories. They will steal almost anything and they are very, very dangerous. But we must get your boat back so let's hope these pirates aren't too bad. Come on, let's use my fishing boat and go looking for your missing yacht. They can't be very far away.\nPhil: The man who gave me the coffee beans is taking us out to sea in his fishing boat. But how are we going to find our yacht? Pirates are lawless and will do anything to protect their bounty – but why does it have to be our yacht? Oh, it could be anywhere now. But hold on… what is it? I think Passepartout has seen something…\nPP: Over there, look! That's our yacht… and I think I can see one… two people on board. Let's hope they haven't sabotaged our yacht.\nPhil: What are we going to do? We don't want to get too close – they might have guns.\nMan: OK, we need to slow down and approach carefully. Let me just look through my binoculars to see if they have guns… hold on! They look familiar.\nPhil: Do you know them?\nMan: Errr… yes! I do.\nSophia: Are they dangerous?\nMan: Absolutely not. They are not fearsome pirates: I used to play with them in the island football team. They didn’t score any goals then and they're not going to sabotage your journey now. Come on, let's get your boat back. \nPP: It's a yacht!\nPhil: We've caught up with our yacht – The Mermaid – and the would-be pirates have given it back to us, and we got an apology. These guys were 'joyriders' – they stole our boat just for a bit of fun – luckily they didn’t cause much damage but they've almost ruined our chances of getting back to London on time.\nMan: So sorry again about these guys. I will make sure they pay for what they did.\nPhil: Farewell and thanks for your help.\nPP: Well, that was a real adventure – now can we get back on course and try and make up for lost time? We have a long way to go.\nSophia: Passepartout, don't forget it was you who hit his head and had to go to hospital remember?\nPP: Err, well, I think it was you who sailed us 500 miles in the wrong direction.\nPhil: Will you two just stop it – we all need to get on and try and work out how we're going to win this challenge and get back to London on time. \nSophia: Don't worry Phil, it's easy – if we head south we'll pick up some trade winds – that will make us much faster. We'll get to Indonesia in just a few days.\nPhil: Sounds like a plan. Passepartout?\nPP: Fine by me. But we've got a long, long way to go – I think we'll need to take turns in sailing while the other two get some sleep.\nSophia: Good idea. I'll steer first and get us back on course. You guys get some sleep – it's been a long and busy day. First Phil, perhaps you can make some of that delicious tea you're good at making, hmm?\nPhil: Aye-aye captain! I've always wanted to say that. Right away Sophia. \nPhil: Making tea! It seems to be the only thing I'm good at doing on this yacht. Ah well, if it keeps the crew happy! Well, we're out in the middle of the Indian Ocean now and we have the wind in our sails. Sophia is on deck and Passepartout is here asleep – you can probably hear him snoring! Actually, I'm feeling… quite sleepy… now. The rolling of the yacht on the waves seems to be rocking me to sleep… like a baby. Maybe I… should get some sleep before… I have to steer… the yacht.\nPP: What? Huh? What was that?\nPhil: I think we've hit something – but what?",

We're in the middle of the Indian Ocean so we can't have hit any rocks. Sophia is up on deck steering the yacht – I need to find out what's going on.\nPP: Err… what's all that noise? I was having a wonderful dream – I was saving the Titanic from hitting an iceberg…\nPhil: Passepartout, something's happened.\nPP: What? Err, where's this water coming from?\nPhil: I'm going up to the deck… Sophia, Sophia, what was that noise? Sophia? Where's Sophia?! She's not here!\nPP: Out of the way, let me have a look… No, she's definitely gone… but hold on, look, we've been swept onto a beach.\nPhil: We're shipwrecked!\nPhil: We've landed on a huge, yellow, sandy beach. And beyond the beach there's a line of palm trees – with coconuts growing on them. It looks like some kind of tropical island. Our satnav says we are at 11 degrees south, 100 degrees east - but according to the map there shouldn’t be any land at this location. Why are we here, and where is Sophia?\nPP: Phil look, there's a hole in the yacht – that's why the water's coming in.\nPhil: Oh no – what are we going to do? We're castaways, stuck here forever.\nPP: Of course we're not. Just go and collect some palm leaves and a few bits of driftwood. Luckily I learnt some yacht repair skills from a TV programme I watched. I should be able to patch her up.\nPhil: Aye-aye captain. We need to get back to sea as soon as possible to look for Sophia.\nPP: Hmm, I don't think we'll see her again. The ocean is huge: it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.\nPhil: But, we must try.\nPhil: We can't give up on Sophia now. I've collected all the bits that Passepartout needs for the repairs. I've made a small fire so I can boil some water and make some much-needed tea. Whilst I was beachcombing I found a beautiful shell. According to my encyclopaedia, it is a rare type of conch shell. That's lucky – it is one of the things I need to collect as part of my challenge. Hmm, that's one bit of good news in a sea of bad news. Right, I just need to take a few photos before we go to put on my travel blog…\nPP: OK, the yacht is fixed, well sort of – give me a hand to scoop out the water that got inside. We'll need to head for somewhere where we can get some proper repairs done. But I think we can be on our way. You just need to help me push her out to sea. Here goes…\nPP: …. Jump on Phil. I'll get the sails up and we'll be on our way.\nPhil: Hey look Passepartout – we've picked up a stowaway. A parrot!\nPP: Hmm, wonderful, now I've got someone I can have a proper conversation with!\nPhil: I think we should keep it – it might bring us some good luck.\nPP: If you say so. Now look, according to our map, I think we'll miss Indonesia and head for Papua New Guinea. With a good tail-wind we should be there… mmm… tomorrow – yes?\nPhil: No Passepartout! We need to sail around here first to search for Sophia. She can't be far away – maybe she fell off when we hit the beach?Hey, I think it's seen something. Quick - where are the binoculars? There! I can see something.\nPhil: Sure enough – the parrot has seen something. We've got closer and yes! It is Sophia – she's floating on some kind of shipping container. I thought she was gone forever, but she's back – and I'm so happy.\nSophia: Phil, Passepartout, over here. Throw me a rope. Oh I'm so pleased to see you again.Oh I'm so hungry and thirsty. I'm so sorry. I fell asleep and a big wave threw me overboard. I tried to call out… but you didn’t hear me. I saw that old container and swam towards it. I was drifting about on it – I thought I would never see you again – I thought I was going to die – but Phil, you saved me.\nPhil: Well… I did, didn't I? But Passepartout helped me too, I think. He fixed the boat.\nSophia: Oh yes, well done – and who is your new friend? \nPP: Just some parrot. It decided to perch on our yacht. It hasn't got a name yet but I suppose it can join us for this trip.\nSophia: Ah, he's cute… I'll try and think of a name. In the meantime, how about some of that wonderful tea Phil? Come on Passepartout, we've no time to waste, we've got to get moving if we're going to win this race.\nPP: Yes, yes, I know that.\nPhil: The team is back together. I'm so pleased we found Sophia – although I'm not so sure Passepartout is. We were making very good progress until we got shipwrecked. That cost us a lot of time and now, only hard work and good luck will get us back to London in 80 days. Our next stop is Papua New Guinea, where we can finish repairing The Mermaid. But how long will that take? Time is running out.",

		"text"		: "Phil: It's day 50. We've made it to Papua New Guinea and the capital city of Port Moresby. People here seem to be wearing masks – I think there's some kind of festival going on. Anyway, this is where we're getting out yacht properly fixed. It needs to be good enough for the next part of our journey. We've decided to sail in a straight line across the Pacific Ocean and then, well, we're taking a short cut through the Panama Canal. It's a long, long way so we need plenty of supplies … but there's a problem…\nPhil: What's wrong Sophia? You look a bit worried.\nSophia: Well I've got all our supplies – milk, water, bread, tea, bird food for the parrot – but I haven't got any money to pay for them. We left Sao Tome in such a rush that I didn't bring any.\nPhil: Don't worry – here, use my credit card.\nSophia: They don't take credit cards here… just cash.\nPhil: Oh really? I don't have much cash either – we could get some wired over to us or maybe Passepartout…\nPP: Well don't look at me – I haven't got any cash – I've just used all my money to buy this Savi mask – isn't it beautiful? A real work of art. You need to collect one for your challenge, don't you?\nPhil: Yes I do - well done. Well, if we haven’t got any cash, we’ll have to sell some of our things. How about the parrot?\nSophia: We can't do that – I've given it a name – Peggy.\nPhil: That's a nice name Sophia. So, no, we cannot sell Peggy. I'll find some books and clothes and things to sell.\nPhil: We've made some money and we’ve got some food and drink. We even had some money left over to buy some lobsters and wine. I'm going to cook a slap-up meal for the crew – but not yet: I'm going to wait until we've sailed for a few days and we're all feeling a bit tired. So off we go again – let's hope the wind is behind us.\nPP: Right, shall we take turns to work and sleep? This time, two people can stay on deck while one of us sleeps. The parrot can do what he wants. We don't want any more little accidents, do we Sophia?\nSophia: Ha ha, very funny. Look, I'll get all the sails up – with this wind behind us we should make up some time – just steer us in the right direction! And Phil, are you OK down there in the galley?\nPhil: Oh yes fine, I'm just cooking us something special to say 'thank you' for all your hard work.\nSophia: You know the way to a woman's heart is through her stomach!\nPP: Hmm, aren't those lobsters we bought getting a bit old? Maybe we should eat the parrot instead?!\nPhil: Everyone's tucking into my meal of boiled lobster, fried potatoes and a pineapple salad with white wine to drink. For dessert I'm serving up fresh coconut. It's amazing what you can cook in such a small kitchen. I'm quite pleased with myself and they seem to be enjoying it but of course, Passepartout is complaining again… as usual…\nPP: An interesting meal Phil – but was the lobster cooked properly? It had a funny taste and… to be honest… I'm feeling rather… sick.\nPhil: Too much wine I expect!\nSophia: He's right… Phil… there was something… funny… I'm going to be… sick.\nPhil: Oh dear. I feel fine – but that's because there wasn't enough lobster for me to eat. Ermm… are you both ok?\nPP and Sophia: No!\nPP: Take charge… you need to sail the yacht.\nPhil: Food poisoning! I've made the crew ill and now I'm the only person well enough to sail the yacht. Now stay calm Phil, I can do this. I can do this. Peggy, do you know how to sail? Of course not, you're a parrot. Right, I'm going east and heading for land at 17 degrees south, 149 degrees west. There's a dirty mark on the map so I can't see what the place is called. Oh no, the weather is getting stormy but I can do this – I need to show Sophia and Passepartout I can sail this yacht by myself so here goes…\nPhil: Ah Passepartout, how are you feeling?\nPP: A little better. Sophia's in the toilet: she's still feeling bad. Oh, well done for sailing the yacht.\nPhil: Oh, it's quite easy with a bit of practice. But the wind's getting stronger and there's a storm coming – could you help move some of the sails around… please?\nPP: I'm afraid… I can't.\nPhil: Oh well, hold tight everyone, I'm going to have to do this alone. I think I can see land… but oh no, I can see some rocks too… maybe I should close my eyes.\nSophia: Phil, pull that rope there…\nPhil: How did I end up in this situation? I'm sailing a yacht, by myself, in a storm. I'm going to hit the rocks, I'm sure I am. First I poison the crew; now I'm going to drown them too. Where is this harbour? Oh, I want to go home!",

		"text"		: "Phil: It's day 61 – and it's a miracle! I didn't hit any rocks and we're safe in the harbour at Papeete on the island of Tahiti. It’s just a quick stop to clean up the yacht and take on fresh water. I'm going to find one more souvenir to take home as part of my challenge – some type of musical instrument – hmmm. And how are my travelling companions? Well, they're not under the weather anymore – I mean, they aren't feeling ill – they've recovered from the food poisoning that I unfortunately gave them – but strangely, they still seem very pleased with me.\nSophia: 'Aloha' Phil! There you are, we were looking for you.\nPhil: Hi. I thought you two should rest, so I went off to buy something. Look, I've bought a 'pahu' – it's a traditional Tahitian drum. I need some kind of exotic instrument as part of my challenge – so here we go. And my credit card works here, so I’ve bought us all some colourful Polynesian shirts – don't they look great?\nSophia: Brilliant – Ilove the palm trees…\nPP: I suppose I could wear it at sea where nobody could see me.\nPhil: And I’ve got some food for Peggy. Now look you two, I'm really sorry about the lobsters and…\nSophia: Be quiet Phil! In fact, well done – you're my hero. You did really well sailing the yacht all by yourself. Look, I found this old captain's hat the back of a drawer in the galley – go on Phil, put it on. You're in charge now! Let me take a photograph. I'm going to put that on Facebook.\nPP: Yes, well done old chap. You've proved me wrong – you're not as useless as you look! Just don't cook us any more of your 'special meals'…\nPhil: OK, I'll stick to making the tea.\nPP: Perhaps you could sail us home now?\nPhil: I think we should work together as a team. I'd love to stay here for longer – it's so beautiful… but we have a job to do. We need to set sail and head for the Panama Canal.\nPP and Sophia: Aye-aye, captain!\nPP: He's not really in charge, is he?\nPhil: Day 65 and we've had the wind in our sails. We're now passing through the Panama Canal. It's an incredible construction and luckily for us saves us thousands of kilometres of sailing around South America. We're not cheating – we are still sailing around the world – but will we do it in 80 days? My companions seem quite confident…\nSophia: Phil, what are you going to spend all the money on when you get home?\nPP: Maybe you could pay me a bit more? Or buy a few more drinks in the pub?\nPhil: I haven't thought about it and anyway, we've got to win this race first, which is looking very unlikely. But I am going to write about our adventures and I hope that this time, someone will buy my book. What about you Sophia, what are you going to do?\nSophia: I really don't know. I sold everything to pay for my trip. I'm going to have to find somewhere to live as soon as I get back to the UK.\nPP: Don't worry Sophia. Phil has a sofa you can sleep on! There's room for that parrot too. And I'm going to start looking for a new job as soon as we get home – Captain of the QE2 maybe?\nPhil: Ah look, we're finally out of the canal. This must be the Caribbean Sea. It's beautiful and it's calm too – there aren't any waves. Look, it looks like a swimming pool.\nPP: That's because there's no wind. We'll have to use the engine for a while until the wind gets up.\nPhil: Day 71 – it's windy. Very, very windy. A radio message has warned us of a hurricane heading our way. The sea is already getting rough. It's time to batten down the hatches and prepare for another very bumpy ride. I'm getting quite used to this!\nSophia: This is wild! We've got to change course – find some shelter.\nPP: Yes, you're right. Our sails will just rip to pieces in this weather.\nPhil: No – I think we should carry on. We've been in worse seas than this. And we can't waste any more time. Come on everyone, we can't let this little storm beat us. We're going to get through this.\nSophia: Are you feeling ok Phil?\nPhil: I'm feeling great.\nPhil: For once I feel like I know what I'm doing. I'm not scared. I’ve got Passepartout, Sophia and our lucky parrot Peggy with me –and that makes me think everything is going to be ok. I hope I'm right!\nPP: OK Phil, maybe it's the captain's hat - but you really are a changed man. Come on then, let's ride this storm.\nSophia: Hold on tight – there's a huge wave coming.\nAll: Whoooahhhh!",

		"text"		: "Phil: Day 73 – we were sailing through a huge hurricane when a massive wave hit us. Oh why did I try to sail through this storm? I was hoping to get back home in 80 days but that seems impossible now. I must make sure my crew is ok – I need them now more than ever…\nPhil: Is everyone OK?\nSophia: Oh, ouch, my arm. Passepartout, are you OK down there?\nPP: Where I am? Who am I?\nPhil: You're Passepartout – you're on a yacht and we were hit by a big wave.\nPP: Oh yes… I knew that… of course… a big wave. Let me just get up… oh my legs… right, I need to inspect the damage.\nSophia: Well, Peggy the parrot seems OK.\nPP: Hooray! Well the satnav is still working but there's a tear in the front sail and everything in the galley is underwater.\nPhil: I'm so sorry. I wanted to carry on through the storm – but I was wrong.\nSophia: It's OK Phil. I thought you were very courageous, very brave. Look we're still alive. We've just got to get back to London, and with the money you'll get, we… I mean you… can enjoy living the rest of your life.\nPhil: Oh Sophia, thank you, I'm so glad we found you.\nPP: We won’t be going anywhere with this damage.\nPhil: We must try Passepartout – never give up!\nPhil: I don't know where all my courage and determination has come from but I like it! We are now sailing across the Atlantic – it doesn't seem as big and scary anymore. We've sailed past the Azores – we couldn't stop to have a rest – and now we're not far from the coastline of Britain, but we've run into some thick fog and we can’t see where we're going. I can hear the foghorn of a lighthouse but we are all so tired, weary and exhausted from our trip that we're… falling… asleep.\nSophia: What's that? We've hit something. We're sinking.\nPhil: Oh no, look, water, water. Abandon ship, abandon ship! Get the lifebelts.\nPP: Quick, set off one of those emergency flares – we need help.\nPhil: Oh no, The Mermaid is sinking, farewell.\nPhil: We've failed to get back home in 80 days. Disaster! We didn’t reach the pub in London on time and we've lost Tom's yacht – the yacht I was supposed to win and then sell to make some money. But we're alive and we have been rescued by a lifeboat. It's taking us to shore where we can make our way to the station, catch a train to London and hopefully meet our friends in the Horse and Groom pub.\nJohn: Phil – goodness, we'd forgotten all about you. And you, Pete.\nPhil: We have been sailing around the world for 80 days… We’ve nearly faced death and you have forgotten about us?!\nTom: He's just joking. It's great to see you again: let me get you a drink and you can tell me all about your adventure but, hold on, who's your new companion?\nPhil: This is Sophia – we met her in Sao Tome and she's helped us sail around the world.\nTom: Pleased to meet you Sophia.\nSophia: Sorry we're a day late.\nTom: A day late? You mean it's day 81? Oh well. In that case, the yacht is still mine. A bet is a bet!\nPhil: Ahh… well, about that. Your yacht… The Mermaid… she's wonderful…. I mean, she was wonderful… we had an accident… we hit some rocks and sank.\nTom: You're joking?!\nSophia: Errr… he's not.We sank off the coast of Cornwall this morning.\nPhil: Tom wasn't pleased to hear the news about his yacht. I was hoping to win our bet. But here we are, with no yacht and no money - and I have to write a story about how we failed to sail around the world in 80 days.\nPP: Excuse me. Can everyone stop talking for a moment – I have an important announcement. I've just double-checked our route on the computer and I realised that at zero degrees west and zero degrees east we crossed the International Date Line.\nTom: Very interesting, Pete – but so what?\nPP: Well when you cross that line you gain an extra day – that means today is only day 80, not day 81!\nPhil: You're right Passepartout – today is day 80. We're on time! What would I do without you?\nSophia: So does that mean Phil has won the challenge after all?\nTom: Well… erm… I suppose so. You went around the world in 80 days – but did you stop to collect the things on your challenge list?\nPhil: I… we got them all. Look… Morna music from Cape Verde, cacao beans from Sao Tome, Bourbon Pointu coffee from Reunion Island, a conch shell from… well we don't know where really, a Savi mask from Papua New Guinea, and a pahu drum from Tahiti.\nTom: Impressive! Congratulations – but I'm afraid you still don’t get a prize – that was my yacht, and you sank it.\nPhil: It's OK. I don't really need it. I've decided there's something much more important. Sophia… I'm so glad we rescued you… I've grown very fond of you and I don’t want to lose you… I know it's going to be complicated but… will you marry me?\nSophia: Oh gosh… well, yes! You're my hero – give me a kiss.\nPP: Oh dear… I suppose I get to keep the parrot?\nPhil: Dear Diary – My adventure is going to make a great story. I'm hoping to sell lots of books this time. Sometimes you need a big adventure to change your life. Even when your journey doesn't go to plan you just learn so much. Luckily for me, I've won a great prize – a loyal friend in Passepartout, and Sophia, a new friend and wife. It's good to be home.",
