		"title"		: "Meet Mary Yellan",
		"text"		: "Mary narrator: My name is Mary, Mary Yellan. I'm 23 years old. I'm not usually very brave, but I feel brave today. Here I am… on this long journey to Cornwall… on my own. I've left the farm where I've lived all my life. I wanted to stay there, but last week I made a promise to my dear Mother…\nMother: [coughing/weak voice] Mary, my child… listen… I won't be in this world much longer.\nMary: Don't say that, Mother.\nMother: It's true, Mary. But, before I go, I have only one wish…\nMary: Yes, Mother dear?\nMother: When I die, promise me you will go and live with my sister, Patience.\nMary: But why can't I stay here on the farm, here in Helford?\nMother: You can't stay here alone.\nMary: But I haven't seen Patience since I was a child!\nMother: I know, but soon she will be the only family you have. [coughing] I have written to her. She has agreed that you can go and live with her and your uncle Joshua. They live on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall. Here, take her letter.\nMary: Bodmin Moor! But that's so far away!\nMary narrator: Mother died last Tuesday. The funeral was yesterday. We buried her next to Papa. Now, I'm on my way to my aunt's house. I've got the letter here…\n[reading] Joss and I now live in Jamaica Inn, where he is landlord. It's on the road between Bodmin and Launceston…\nThis journey is so long! We have been travelling for hours. What a wild and lonely county Cornwall is. My only consolation is that I will see my aunt again after so many years. Oh how pretty she was with her golden hair and blue eyes! Always laughing, enjoying ourselves…\nBut I never visited her and I never met her husband either. … Ah, at last, I can see houses and people – this must be Bodmin town.\nThere is just me and one other traveller left. It's so cold and grey outside… The rain is lashing against the window. I wish it would stop! All I can see is mile upon mile of empty moorland. No trees… no houses… I wonder how many more hours we have to travel?\nMary: Excuse me, sir – is it much further?\nMan: Where are you going?\nMary: Jamaica Inn… Do you know it?\nMan: Maybe I do and maybe I don't… and why are you going there?\nMary: I'm going to live there… with my aunt and uncle.\nMan: That will be Joss Merlyn... People say that queer things go on at Jamaica Inn.\nMary: What do you mean – queer?\nMan: It's just what they say. But respectable people don't go there any more. It's a lonely place.\nMan: If I were you, Miss, I would go on to Launceston tonight and go back to Bodmin tomorrow.\nMary: But I can't. My aunt and uncle are waiting for me.\nMan: Jamaica Inn is no place for a young woman.\nMary: I have nowhere else to go…\nMary narrator: What can he mean by 'queer things'? Why is he looking at me in that curious way?\nDriver: Whoa boy…! Slow now.\nMary: Why have we stopped here – it's the middle of nowhere?\nDriver: Jamaica Inn! There you go Miss.\nMary: But there's nothing here! Oh – what's that? There up on the moor - a dark building with tall chimneys. I can see a path to the door. There's a sign twisting in the wind. It says 'Jamaica Inn'.\nMary narrator: Suddenly I feel frightened. I want to climb back in the coach.\nToo late – it's already gone... I suppose my only choice now is to enter Jamaica Inn.\nNext time we meet – I get to meet my Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss. I discover what a mean and scary man my uncle is. And I discover a locked room – what is inside?",

		"text"		: "Mary narrator: I have arrived at Jamaica Inn to live with my aunt. My uncle is landlord here. It's a cold and lonely place. I'm at the door and I'm waiting for someone to let me in…\nJoss: Who's there?\nMary: It's me. Mary. Mary Yellan.\n[Heavy door opening]\nJoss: Ah, so, you've arrived at last. Well, say hello to your Uncle Joss.\nMary: Where is my Aunt Patience?\nJoss: What's the hurry? Don't you want to give me a big kiss first? Patience! She's here. [impatiently] Where are you, woman?\nPatience! Where in hell is that woman?\nPatience: I'm here. Is it the girl?\nJoss: See for yourself.\nMary narrating: A woman with grey hair hurries towards me. In the candlelight her face is pale. She looks afraid.\nPatience: Mary.\nMary: Aunt Patience - I am so glad to see you.\nMary narrating: But she is unrecognisable. Her curls have gone and her happy smile also. I can see that she's been crying. This woman is old and anxious. She starts to cry.\nJoss: Stop whimpering, woman. Can't you see the girl is hungry! I'll take her things up to her room. If there's nothing to eat on the table when I come down, you'll soon have something to cry about.\nMary narrating: He lifts my heavy box as if it's a bag of feathers. He is huge with shoulders like those of a bear.\nMary narrating: The kitchen is full of smoke from the fire. There are stains on the stone floor and there's a strong smell of alcohol. On the table there are two empty bottles of brandy.\nPatience: You mustn't mind your Uncle Joss. Some people find him strange at first, but he is very respected here. Just yesterday he told me that a man stopped and told him how much he admired.\nJoss: Are you talking rubbish again woman? Sit down Mary. Eat. Listen, Mary. I'm in charge here and you'll do as I say. You'll serve the customers in the bar and help in the house. But if you open your mouth and squawk like a hen, you'll be sorry.\nMary: I'll help you like you say, but if you hurt my aunt, I'll tell and you'll be punished.\nJoss: Patience, go and get me another bottle and be quick. Big words – maybe we're not so different, Mary. Here, drink this.This is my curse, Mary – drink. I've been drinking a little today but - Oh you'll see how we drink here some Saturdays – they hear the shouting and singing far away. People are afraid of me but I'm afraid of no one. Go to bed now.\nMary narrating: He suddenly grabs my wrist.\nJoss: Listen carefully. Some nights you'll hear wheels, footsteps and voices outside. You must stay in your room and put your blanket over your ears. If you ask questions, I'll break every bone in your body. Do you understand?\nMary narrating: My room is small and bare. Just a bed and a table with a broken mirror. I feel lonely and trapped like a bird in a cage. But it's not too late to run away. I creep down the dark passage.\nMary: [to herself] Who's crying? It must be my aunt!\nMary narrating: I turn back. My uncle frightens me but I must stay and protect Aunt Patience.\nI did not sleep well last night. My bed is hard and the blanket is thin. The house is quiet this morning. I'll look for a place to wash downstairs. Here is the bar. Ah, there's a passage here – maybe it's along here. A door – this must be the washroom.\nMary: How strange – it's locked.\nPatience: Mary! What are you doing?\nMary: Why is this room locked, Aunt Patience? What's in it?\nMary narrating: My aunt looks quickly behind her and her eyes are like a frightened rabbit's.\nMary: Is it because of the people who come to the inn at night?\nPatience: Mary. Mary. I've been worrying about how to tell you this. I must warn you. Bad things happen here. Men come at night and they go into that room with Joss. When you hear them, you must stay in your room. You must never ask me or your uncle about it again.\nMary narrating: What is in this room and why is my Aunt so scared? I'm not going to like it here but I must stay to support her and keep her safe. Next time we meet – I have to work in the bar of Jamaica Inn on Saturday night where I get to meet a group of rough and drunk men. Later that night there are some strange goings-on in the yard outside. What's going on at Jamaica Inn?",

		"text"		: "Mary narrator: I've not seen my uncle much since I arrived. I am glad because he's got a violent temper and treats my aunt badly. This morning, I've been exploring the country around the inn…\nThere is nothing but heather and grass for miles. In the distance I can see the marsh. It was in this wild and lonely land that my uncle lived as a boy with his two brothers. Last night he told me their story.\nJoss: If you had lived here, you would have taken to drink, like I did… it makes you do things. I had a family once: a father, mother, two brothers, but each one of them disappeared one way or another. My father was hanged. He killed a man. My brother Jem is clever – but they'll catch him, too and hang him. My brother Matthew – well, he drowned in the marsh. They found him one summer when the marsh dried up…\nMary narrator: When I get back to the inn my uncle is there...\nJoss: Well, did you miss me?\nMary: Did you have a nice trip?\nJoss: Nice, be damned. I've been riding for four days. There was a bit of money involved - that's all I care about.\nMary: Well, I'll go and help my aunt...\nJoss: It's me you'll be helping tonight, in the bar...\nMary narrator: It's Saturday night – the bar is crowded. The air is full of smoke and the smell of unwashed bodies. All of them are drunk. Some men are so drunk that they lie on the benches like dead men.\nHarry (man in bar): Another pint…\nJoss: Hurry up there, girl.\nMary: Uncle, I cannot bear this. I'm going upstairs.\nJoss: Too good for us are you? Well it's almost midnight now. Go to your room and lock your door …\nMary: Oww! Let go of my wrist! You're hurting me!\nJoss: Hear this: Keep your mouth shut, and you won't get hurt - but if you start to ask...\nMary: Oh! What's that noise? It's coming from under my room…\nMary narrator: The moonlight pours into my room creating ghostly shadows. I creep over to the window. My uncle is below and I recognise other men from earlier this evening. There are four or five wagons. The men have been taking big boxes from them into the inn.\nHarry: That's the last of them.\nJoss: Good. Get going now. Be quick…\nMan: What will you do about him?\nJoss: Don't worry. Harry and I will deal with him later…\nMary narrator: I understand now. They are smuggling! Jamaica Inn is a perfect place for it. But what's my uncle doing at the moment? I have to go and see…\nAs I get closer to the bar, I hear voices. I hide in the shadows.\nMan: No, and no again – I will not be a part of it - that's murder you are talking about Mr Merlyn … killing innocent women and children – no!\nJoss: Not so fast! By God, you will do as I say. Another man said the same and he was hanging at the end of a rope a few minutes later! Harry – you go and lock the door behind you. I'll finish here…\nMary narrator: I feel sick. My heart has been beating so loudly, I am sure they have heard it. I go back to my room quietly…\nMary: What shall I do? If I had a gun or a knife, I could perhaps hurt my uncle so that the man can escape…But I have nothing …I must do something, though ….\nMary narrator: I creep downstairs again. The door to the bar is shut. There is silence. I suddenly know I have to open the door to find out.\nMary: There's no one here! Just the tables and a few empty glasses…The door is open at the back. But wait… what's that hanging in the middle of the room? It's swinging… A rope hanging from a hook in the ceiling! But there's nothing on the end of it. What's happened to that man? I fear the worst…\nMary narrator: Next time we meet, an interesting visitor arrives at Jamaica Inn. But who is he and can he be trusted?",

Today, I am alone cleaning the kitchen. But the quiet does not last...\nMary: Who can that be?\nMary narrator: When I go in the bar, there's a man with a glass of beer. He looks familiar…\nMary: What do you think you're doing? You can't help yourself to drink!\nJem: Are you the barmaid? Fill up my glass.\nMary: Fill it up yourself. I'll tell Mr Merlyn you are here.\nJem: Don't bother - he won't want to see me…\nMary: Well, I can't stand here waiting. Pay up and you can go.\nJem: Do you order Joss around like that?\nMary: He's my uncle. Patience was my mother's sister. Now, I have work to do… uncle!\nJoss: Who the hell are you talking to? I told you to keep your mouth shut! Oh, it's you, Jem. What do you want? You can get on with your work, Mary…\nMary narrator: So that was Jem, my uncle's brother. He's got the same dark eyes and hair, but drink has not ruined his face – it's younger and more handsome.\nJem: Excuse me - I didn't expect to see a girl like you at Jamaica Inn.\nMary: My mother died, so I came here. I'm glad she isn't alive to see how my aunt lives now. I try to help her in the house. What do you do?\nJem: I steal horses.\nMary: Oh! Aren't you afraid of being caught?\nJem: Not really. Listen, I'm being serious now. Jamaica Inn is no place for you with its ugly business. I can help you go to Bodmin.\nMary: I don't need help. I can look after myself.\nJem: Well... I'm going now. But remember – I live in Trewartha if you ever need me.\nMary narrator: How can I trust him? He's a thief - and he's Joss's brother. The loneliness of my situation grips me again.\nThe men have returned. From my window, I can see them lifting heavy objects onto the wagons. These men are desperate and dangerous. And Jem…? Did he come to warn his brother that they were coming?\nThis morning, I'm doing the washing. My uncle is away, so I can almost feel the happiness I used to feel when I worked on the farm.\nPatience: Mary!\nMary: What is it?\nPatience: Mr Bassat is here - the magistrate, with another man. What are we going to do? He's never been before: he must know something.\nPatience: What am I going to say?\nMary narrator: This is my chance to tell an officer about Joss - but look at my aunt. She is trembling and terrified.\nMary: Just say Joss is away.\nPatience: Mary, you won't tell Mr Bassat about the wagons, will you? If anything happens to Joss, I'll kill myself.\nMr Bassat: You took your time. Where's the landlord?\nMary: He's not here. \nMr Bassat: When will he be back?\nPatience: He went out after breakfast. I don't know when he's getting back.\nMr Bassat: Damn! Listen to me – your husband is giving this whole area - my land - a bad reputation.\nPatience: I don't know what you mean. We live a quiet life here - my niece will tell you!\nMr Bassat: I'm not a fool. We'll look around now we are here.\nMary narrator: Mr Bassat is having a good look around the inn. He knows there is something hidden here.\nMr Bassat: This place is a disgrace! Call yourself an inn! There isn't one clean room.\nPatience: Mary, Mary - the room by the bar!\nMary narrating: We come to the locked room.\nMary: I'm afraid this room is locked.\nMr Bassat: Why?\nMary: I don't know…\nMr Bassat: Have you ever heard wheels and horses at night?\nMary: No, never.\nMr Bassat: Where is the key to the room?\nMary: My uncle has it.\nMr Bassat: Well, we'll have to break down the door, then.\nMary narrating: I'm afraid. I hate lying to save my uncle - and part of me will be glad if they find evidence of his crimes. I remember the rope. But the fear of what might lie behind the door is clear in my aunt's eyes.

He storms out of the house and sets off across the moor. Suddenly I have a mad plan. I put on my shoes and follow him.\nMary: He's walking too fast. I can't keep up. It's no good - he's disappeared! It's getting dark. I must go back… Do I go right or left here? I don't remember this stream… Oh no! I'm totally lost!\nVicar: Hello, what are you doing out on the moor?\nMary: I'm lost.\nVicar: Where are you going?\nMary: Jamaica Inn.\nVicar: That's the other side of the moor - but you're exhausted! Come back with me. You can rest and I'll take you back.\nMary: You're very kind.\nMary narrator: He looks strange. His hair is white, and his eyes are pale. His voice is young, though.\nVicar: I'm Francis Davey, Vicar of Altarnun. Please, come.\nVicar: Are you feeling better now?\nMary: Yes, thank you.\nMary narrator: He has white hair and his eyes are like a blind man's – and yet his voice is gentle.\nVicar: It was lucky I ran into you. Why were you on the moor tonight?\nMary narrator: Suddenly I want to tell him everything.\nMary: It's terrible! You've probably heard rumours. They come at night, with their wagons. That first night there were six or seven of them. They brought huge boxes - they put them in a room by the bar. A man was killed - I saw the rope! Oh! What have I done? I shouldn't have said anything!\nVicar: Don't worry – I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to.\nMary: But what should I do?\nVicar: Wait. Watch your uncle. When the wagons come, tell me immediately.\nMary: What about the man who was killed? Can't we do something about that?\nVicar: I think not. If there was a body, the police would surely investigate – but that's unlikely now. Could it be your imagination? All you saw was a piece of rope.\nMary: I heard my uncle threaten him.\nVicar: People threaten others every day. Listen: you can talk to me any time.\nMary narrator: He drives me home. My uncle has been drinking. He stays drunk for five days. Today it's sunny, so I am out on the moor again.\nMary: Where do these ponies come from?\nJem: Hey! Mary!\nMary: Oh, hello!\nJem: I didn't expect you so soon!\nMary: I didn't plan to come this way.\nJem: So what's been happening at Jamaica Inn?\nMary: We had a visit from Mr Bassat.\nJem: Did you now? How much do you know Mary?\nMary: I just want to get my aunt away. Your brother can drink himself to death for all I care.\nJem: So the smuggling doesn't shock you? What about murder, though?\nMary: I don't know what you mean.\nJem: Why are you so silent, Mary? Even a child would know something was going on at Jamaica Inn. 'We're bad, us Merlyns - and Jem is the worst.' Is that what you're thinking?\nMary: Something like that, but I'm not afraid of you. I'd even like you if you didn't remind me of your brother.\nJem: I'm better looking!\nMary: I must get back.\nJem: Are you coming with me to Launceston on Christmas Eve? I want to sell this pony.\nMary: And if you're caught selling a stolen pony, I'll go to prison like you.\nJem: I won't be caught. Come, don't you like a bit of excitement?\nMary: Well... where shall we meet?\nMary narrator: It's late when I get back and my uncle is lying drunk in the kitchen, surrounded by empty bottles. My aunt is in bed.\nJoss: Who's there? Put away that knife!\nMary: Uncle Joss, it's me, Mary.\nJoss: Mary - where are they?\nMary: There's no one here. What's wrong, Uncle Joss?\nJoss: They can't hurt me now. They're all dead. Sit by me, Mary… It's this drink! I've killed men with my own hands. But when I'm drunk I'm afraid. I see them in my dreams, floating on the water... The ship: it was on the rocks but the water was flat and they were coming into the shore alive! We had to kill them all. One woman – she was holding on to some wood with her child. The water was only up to her shoulder. She cried out to me to help her: I took a stone and smashed her with it. I watched her and her child drown in four feet of water. We killed them all with stones and rocks.\nMary narrator: My blood turns cold, and I feel sick. My uncle is a murderer - that I suspected, but what he has just told me chills me to the bone. What terrible crime will he carry out next?\nJoin me in the next episode when I go to the horse market with Jem, but things don't go to plan.",

Memories of what I saw on Christmas Eve haunt me like a nightmare …\nMy uncle forced me to travel with him and his drunken men on Christmas Eve. I was so tired on the journey that while they were singing drunken songs, I fell asleep.\nWhen I woke up, they had gone. The carriage doors were locked, but I escaped through the window.\nThey had brought me to the coast. It was a cold, misty night, but from where I was standing on the clifftop, I could see my uncle and his gang below on the shore, silent and still. They were watching the tide coming in, like a beast waiting to pounce.\nThe mist began to clear and a light appeared on a nearby cliff. At last! The officers the vicar had spoken about were coming! … But my hope disappeared quickly. … Another light appeared out at sea. This one was moving up and down… I realised then with horror what was happening. The light on the cliff was a trap!\nA huge black shape appeared out of the darkness. Like a moth to a candle, the ship was heading for the rocks…\nI remember now how I ran to the shore, how I screamed and shouted… but my uncle caught me and tied my hands so I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything except watch the disaster happen.\nMary: The men splashed about in the water grabbing treasures that had fallen from the ship. Bodies were floating on the water. The men fell on them and took everything of value … even rings on the fingers. Hours passed. Light was appearing in the sky. My uncle saw it too.\nJoss: Whoah!! … Stop everyone! Look!\nMary narrating: He pointed to the sky.\nHarry: Just … going … to get …\nJoss: Leave it! … There's no time!… It's getting light … Get out of here!… … before it's too late.\nMary narrating: But no one was listening. They were greedily grabbing what they could.\nMary narrating: My uncle had fired his pistol in the air. The men looked up and saw the sky. Fear struck them and they ran up the beach, carrying what they could… They knew they had stayed too long. Morning was their enemy. … I was too weak to move, but my uncle picked me up and carried me… In the panic, the carriage overturned. That meant there was only one small cart for everyone's escape.\nJoss: Stand back!… I say stand back!…Harry, make sure no one moves… Shoot if necessary… I said…\nMary narrating: There was blood everywhere…two men lay still… I fainted.\nPatience: Mary, are you awake?\nMary: How long have I been lying here?\nPatience: Two days.\nMary: Why didn't you wake me?\nPatience: Mary…I…\nMary: I've got to get up …\nPatience: Where are you going? Your uncle is downstairs.\nMary: He doesn't frighten me… I must go and find….\nPatience: He's never been like this before. He's locked all the doors. He's afraid of someone … I don't know who…\nPatience: Don't go down, Mary, he's got a gun…!\nMary narrating: All the doors and windows are bolted. My uncle is sitting in the kitchen…\nJoss: I heard noises outside. Did you hear anything?...\nHe'll come… He warned me but I didn't listen…We didn't plan it this time.\nMary: What do you mean? Who warned you? The officers?\nJoss: Them…? They can't touch me. They need proof and all they have is a broken ship and two bodies. I wasn't there, was I – I was at home with my wife and niece cosy by the fire… No, it's him… He'll murder us all…\nMary: I don't understand. My uncle planned the wrecks, didn't he… or did he? Was there someone else who gave the orders? Who is he so afraid of?\nPatience: Why don't we get away quickly now?\nJoss: You idiot! There are people everywhere who know what I've done. They'd like to see me hang … we'll stay till night time, when it's dark… We'll leave then!\nMary narrating: I go along with my uncle's plan, but in my mind I'm making other plans – I'll escape somehow and find the vicar…. He's my only hope....\nMeet me in the next episode when things get even worse and I make a shocking discovery that will completely change my life at Jamaica Inn.",

		"text"		: "Mary narrating: My uncle is planning our escape from Jamaica Inn tonight. He's afraid that someone is coming to kill him – someone who has been giving him the orders to wreck ships. He thinks I'm resting in my room and he has locked my door. But I climbed out of the window and am hurrying to the vicar's house before my uncle discovers I've gone. The vicar will help me, I'm sure …\nAh there's the church and the vicarage. I can't see any lights, though.\nMary: Mr Davey… Mr Davey… It's Mary … Mary Yellan. No one's here…\nExcuse me, is the vicar in the church? I've been knocking at the house but there's no answer.\nWoman: No, he left this morning and won't be back until tomorrow.\nMary: Are you sure? Oh… what shall I do?... I've got to find someone to help me…\nWoman: Why don't you go to Mr Bassat, the magistrate? He lives at North Hill, but it's four miles away.\nMary: I'll have to go there…But first… I must … write … a note for Mr Davey. Here… can you give this to him…?\nWoman: But you can't walk! – it's getting dark …\nMary narrating: In my note, I explained about the wreck and my uncle's plan to escape… I'll have to walk quickly to North Hill. If my uncle discovers I've gone, he'll know I've betrayed him and he'll kill me.\nMary: I need to see Mr Bassat – it's urgent!\nMrs Bassat: I'm afraid he's not here.\nMary: Oh no!… If I don't see him, something terrible will happen!\nMrs Bassat: It's not about the horses is it? … I know one was quite ill this morning…\nMary: No … When will Mr Bassat be back?\nMrs Bassat: I really don't know. Actually, I'm very worried. He knows a man called Joss Merlyn who's very dangerous, so he might be in serious danger.\nMary: What do you mean?\nMrs Bassat: My husband has suspected for a long time that's he committed serious crimes and this morning, he suddenly got proof. He's gone to Launceston to get men and will surround the Inn this evening… there may be fighting…but do you know this man Merlyn? Wait a moment…you are the girl my husband told me about, aren't you? Don't move…!\nMary: Don't… I won't hurt you… I came to tell Mr Bassat that my uncle is planning to escape tonight. But I've ruined your husband's plan. When my uncle sees I'm not in my room, he'll leave before your husband gets there…\nMrs Bassat: I can see you're telling the truth. How can I help you…?\nMary: I must go back and help my aunt. I'm really worried about her… [puzzled and trying to work out] But how did Mr Bassat find out the truth so soon?\nMrs Bassat: I've no idea. He left very suddenly … But you can't possibly walk back alone now – it's dark. Our servant, James, will see you home safely.\nMary: Really … there's no need. I'm used to the roads at night…\nMary narrating: But she insisted… so I am once again on the road to Jamaica Inn. The moor is cold and still tonight… James has two guns and if I have to … I'll use one… There is the inn …\nMary: It looks like Mr Bassat hasn't got here yet. I must find my aunt… Perhaps they've already gone. I'll go in alone. Give me a gun James. If you hear a shot, then come.\nStrange… the house is dark… but the horses are still here. So they haven't gone yet! Unless they went on foot, but no… my aunt wouldn't have done that. How odd!\nMary narrating: The kitchen is empty. The fire is dead. Nothing but a deathly silence. I creep to the hall, terrified of meeting my uncle with a gun. [gasps!]\nA terrible sight is there before me… I turn and run as fast as I can…\nLet's meet again in the next episode – after the shocking events of today I go to the safety of the vicar's house – he has something important to tell me, but what can it be?",

		"title"		: "The Vicar of Altarnum",
		"text"		: "Mary narrating: I'm at the Vicar's house. I'm here because last night, when I returned to the inn, I found my uncle – dead... lying on the floor with a knife in his back. When Mr Bassat arrived with his men, they found my aunt's body upstairs... she'd also been stabbed.\nThe vicar suggested I stay with him. He came to the inn as soon as he read my note. He's not here. He left before I woke up.\nWhile I've been waiting for him, I've been thinking about who the killer could be. Mr Bassat asked me if I had an idea who it was. I told him I didn't... but that's not true... I remember how Jem told me that he hated his brother... so they'll catch and hang him... or else he'll ride away, laughing at me. Either way, I know that I love him.\nStrange how this room is so empty... No books, no paintings... Not like the vicar's house in Helford where I lived with my mother... His living room had pictures of smiling angels and village scenes... and piles of books on the desk.\nThere's nothing on this desk. I know... I'll write and ask if I can stay with him. Now, where's a pen and paper? Ah... in this drawer perhaps. That's odd! Nothing in the drawer, wait, there is a piece of paper... oh but it's already got something on it... a picture – by the vicar ­­– his initials are there. What a strange picture.\nIt makes me shiver... It's the village church with the vicar and his congregation... but all the people have got sheep's heads and look stupid. The vicar has drawn himself as a wolf but not an ordinary wolf, a laughing wolf... What does it mean...? Oh no! He's back... quick! I shut the drawer quickly and sit by the fire. I'm shaking.\nMary: Oh, Vicar...\nVicar: Did I startle you? I'm sorry I was so long. My horse was lame. You must be hungry?\nMary narrating: I find it difficult to speak... The picture has shocked me. The vicar asks me to get the food from the kitchen. When I return, there are papers all over the desk. He's been burning letters.\nVicar: Don't you want to know what I've been doing today?\nMary: I'm sorry - I haven't thanked you for your kindness last night. If you hadn't taken me in, I wouldn't have had anywhere to stay.\nVicar: Well... I've been to North Hill. Mr Bassat invited me and others to discuss the murder.\nMary: Does Mr Bassat suspect anyone?\nVicar: They've found the man, Harry... He can't be the murderer though. He would have been a suspect if he hadn't been locked up in the room by the bar for the last few days. But he said that someone else gave your uncle orders. This person must be the murderer. Don't you agree?\nMary: Well... er... Yes, I suppose...\nVicar: It can't be one of the men. This person is clever. He must have come to the inn and he knows the moor well. He probably lives nearby. Did anyone like this come to the inn?\nMary: Er... no... I can't think... \nVicar: Why do you look so anxious, Mary? But I forgot... I saw a friend of yours today at North Hill.\nMary: I have no friends except you...\nVicar: But you told me you went to Launceston with your uncle's brother...\nMary narrating: I froze... I didn't know what to say...\nVicar: He gave me a message for you. Tell her that \"I'm sorry\". I...\nMary: Jem was at North Hill? Why?\nVicar: Well, he's the dead man's brother. He wasn't upset, though...\nMary: Was Mr Bassat asking him questions?\nVicar: They've been talking all day. He's got brains - more than his brother. You told me he lives nearby, and steals horses?\nMary narrating: I can't look at him, but I feel his eyes studying my face... He knows the truth.\nMary: What will they do to him, Mr Davey?\nVicar: 'Do'? What do you mean? I'm sure he won't be punished since he has helped them.\nMary: 'Helped'? I don't understand.\nVicar: Mary, it was Jem who informed Mr Bassat about his own brother. They left Launceston together after the horse market. Mr Bassat told him he could go free if he gave them proof about his brother and he did.\nMary narrating: I can't believe it... I was so sure...\nMary: Oh, Vicar, I'm such a fool... Where is Jem now?\nVicar: He's gone to find the blacksmith... He found a nail in the field by the inn. It must belong to the killer's horse. Only one person went to the blacksmith yesterday...\nMary: How do you know?\nVicar: Because I know who that person was.\nMary narrating: His strange eyes are staring at me... I can't breathe! He knows who the murderer is!\nMeet me in the next episode when I finally discover the shocking truth about who killed my aunt and uncle at Jamaica Inn. I am also in danger but who will come to my rescue?",

		"title"		: "The truth is out",
		"text"		: "Mary narrating: The Vicar of Altarnum has just told me he knows who murdered my uncle and aunt. I look at him in horror, and slowly, the awful truth becomes clear...\nVicar: Yes, Mary. I planned the wrecks. Your uncle followed my orders but they thought he was the leader. He loved that. No one knew about me. But then you came and asked questions. They had to die because of that... The end was near in any case. The fool got drunk on Christmas Eve. Well, you saw what happened... the whole country knew what he'd done. With a rope round his neck, he'd have told them about me.\nMary: At least my uncle didn't lie - he talked and dreamt about his crimes. You... you hid yours behind the cross and the face of a priest. But why are you telling me all this now?\nVicar: I know you found the picture... I saw it had been moved. It frightened you, didn't it? \"Who is this strange man?\" you thought. Yes, Mary I am strange. Oh, but they listened to me in church and followed me like sheep.\nNow, get ready. We've got to leave.\nMary: We?!\nVicar: Yes, you're coming with me - you'll be a good companion. I've admired your courage since we first met.\nMary: And if I don't come with you?\nVicar: You're no fool, Mary. There are no houses nearby and your screams won't be heard.\nMary: You know that I'll run away at the first village.\nVicar: You won't be able to. There aren't any villages on the Cornish coast because of the steep cliffs... just birds, and when we're on the ship...\nMary: You're leaving England?\nVicar: Of course - we'll go to Spain, to Africa... Get ready now.\nMary narrating: I think quickly. I look at the clock... Jem will have reached the blacksmith and will know the truth. He'll realise I'm in serious danger so he will follow us... If I go with the vicar, at least I'll slow him down a bit, so Jem will have a chance to catch up...\nI have no choice in any case. \nWe cross the dark, empty moor quickly, avoiding the roads. The moon is hidden behind clouds... The Vicar has luck on his side.\nAs the ground becomes softer, we slow down... The marshes lie waiting. The Vicar knows, as I do, that one wrong step will result in a horrible death.\nMary: Oh, where is Jem?\nVicar: Whoah! \nMary narrating: A wall of fog rises in front of us.\nVicar: It's no good. We can't see anything. We'll have to wait until light. We'll sleep here... on these rocks, out of the wind.\nMary narrating: I drift in and out of sleep.\nVicar: Shhh! Be quiet!\nMary narrating: I'm woken by his cold hand on my mouth.\nI can still hear the wind, but there is something else, too...\nWe leave the horses and he drags me higher and higher...\nMary: I can't go any further.\nVicar: Stay here, then.\nMary narrating: The last I see of him - he's standing on a rock with his arms stretched out...\nVicar: (gunshot) Aaaah!\nMary narrating: I look up. Jem is about 100 metres away behind a rock with a gun.\nI haven't seen Jem since he shot the vicar. The Bassat family have been looking after me. They've asked me to stay and look after their children... but I long for the green fields and valleys of Helford. I'm walking for the last time on the moor. Tomorrow I'll go back and live quietly on the farm.\nMary: Someone is coming this way... but I can't see who because the sun is in my eyes...\nJem: Hello Mary. I heard you're going to go and live at North Hill?\nMary: They've asked me, but no... I'm going back to Helford tomorrow... And you, are you leaving Cornwall?\nJem: Yes, I'm going to start a new life... I've got my whole home with me here. I may go north. Perhaps I'll breed horses instead of stealing them. Come with me, Mary.\nMary: I miss my home in Helford... I want to see the trees and animals...\nJem: Go then and live on your farm.\nMary: That's not very kind.\nJem: I speak unkindly to my horses when they're obstinate. it doesn't mean I don't love them. Well, I'll be on my way... Goodbye Mary.\nMary: Wait! Are you saying you love me?\nJem: Maybe... It'll be a hard life.\nMary: I know, I'll take my chance... and we'll be together.\nMary narrating: So, I cross the moor for the last time - and for the first time, it looks beautiful in the sunshine. Behind me lies Jamaica Inn, empty, no more secrets - they have all been told... my new life is about to begin.",
