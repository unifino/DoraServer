		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,020\nHello there. Welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,740\nI'm Ty Burrell, and today I'll be reading \"Mice Twice,\"\n\n3\n00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,100\nwritten and illustrated by Joseph Low.\n\n4\n00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,120\nCat was thinking about supper.\n\n5\n00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,860\nHe thought, \"I could eat forty-seven grasshoppers.\nOr I could eat sixty-nine crickets.\n\n6\n00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,820\nOr I could eat a fine, fat sparrow.\n\n7\n00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,800\nBut what I think I'd really like is a nice, tender mouse.\"\n\n8\n00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,040\nSo he went outside and sat at Mouse's door.\n\n9\n00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,620\n\"Are you there, Mouse,\" he asked, \"and in good health, I hope?\"\n\n10\n00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,540\nMouse lay snug in her nest behind the door. The door was too small for Cat to get through.\n\n11\n00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,080\n\"Never better,\" she said.\n\n12\n00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,420\nCat tuned his rough voice to make it smooth.\n\n13\n00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:08,820\nHe said, \"Such a lovely day! I was just thinking,\n'How nice to have a friend for supper.'\nI do hope you can join me this evening.\"\n\n14\n00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,740\nMouse knew Cat well, and all his cunning ways.\n\"May I bring a friend?\" she asked.\n\n15\n00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:25,000\n(\"Mice twice!\" thought Cat, licking his whiskers.)\n\"By all means,\" he said. \"Shall we say six o'clock?\"\n\n16\n00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,440\n\"Six will be fine,\" said Mouse.\n\n17\n00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,980\nAt six that evening she knocked on Cat's door. Cat's stomach rumbled.\n\n18\n00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:41,980\n\"Come in, come in!\" he said.\nBut when he opened the door, he saw that Mouse's friend was not another mouse.\n\n19\n00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,520\nIt was Dog. Dog was grinning.\nHe was twice as big as Cat.\n\n20\n00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,760\nCat was angry, but he was afraid to show it.\n\n21\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,840\nHe waved them into the house. On the table were two small bits of cheese.\n\n22\n00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,700\n\"Such a warm day!\" said Cat. \"I find it best not to eat on warm days. But do help yourselves.\"\n\n23\n00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,040\nSo Mouse took one piece of cheese.\nAnd Dog took the other.\n\n24\n00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,240\nWhen he had swallowed his, Dog said, \"I have seldom enjoyed a cheese so much. Is it Swiss?\"\n\n25\n00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,800\n\"Or is it French?\" asked Mouse.\n\n26\n00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,920\n\"French,\" said Cat. \"A gift from my cousin Pierre.\"\n\n27\n00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,320\n(Actually, it was common old rat-trap cheese, as Dog and Mouse knew very well.)\n\n28\n00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,000\nDog said, \"It has been so pleasant, dear Cat. I hope you will have dinner with me tomorrow night.\"\n\n29\n00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,760\nCat thought for a moment.\n\"I will, indeed,\" he said, \"if I may bring a friend.\"\n\n30\n00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,760\n\"Good company makes for good eating,\" said Dog.\n\"Bring any friend you like. Shall we say seven o'clock?\"\n\n31\n00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,480\n\"Seven will be fine,\" said Cat.\n\n32\n00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,240\nAt seven the next night, Cat knocked on Dog's door.\n\n33\n00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:11,100\nBeside him stood Wolf -- twice as big as Dog. Four times as fierce.\n\n34\n00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,020\n\"Come in, come in!\" called Dog.\n\n35\n00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,040\nCat looked at Wolf. He whispered, \"Dog for you. Mouse for me? Agreed?\"\n\n36\n00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,580\nWolf said nothing, but curled his lip in a horrid smile. All his sharp teeth were showing.\n\n37\n00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,560\nCat and Wolf both licked their whiskers.\n\n38\n00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,640\nBut when the door opened, there beside Dog sat Crocodile.\n\n39\n00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,080\nHis big, toothy jaws opened and closed as he smiled at Cat and Wolf.\n\n40\n00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:49,600\nCat and Wolf stared at that gaping mouth.\nSo big! So red! So many, many teeth!\n\n41\n00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,800\nThey could not take their eyes away. Not even to look at the four pieces of cheese on the table.\n\n42\n00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,240\n\"Ummmm,\" said Wolf, looking over his shoulder at the door.\n\n43\n00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:09,300\n\"Actually,\" said Cat, \"we came to ask if we might make it another night. Neither of us is feeling well.\"\n\n44\n00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:18,180\n\"What a pity!\" said Dog, \"I had so hoped you might enjoy this delicate French cheese. Brie, it is called.\"\n\n45\n00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,700\n(And it really was French Brie.)\n\n46\n00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,540\n\"Another time,\" mumbled Cat as he and Wolf backed out the door.\n\n47\n00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,320\nCat thought for a moment, looking back at Crocodile.\n\n48\n00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:40,240\n\"Tomorrow night,\" he said, \"I'd like you to meet a distant relative who will be visiting me for dinner. Can you join me -- and bring your friend?\"\n\n49\n00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,680\n\"Delighted,\" said Dog.\n\"But not Crocky, here. He must get back to the river tonight.\n\n50\n00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,700\nPerhaps Mouse might come, if that is agreeable?\"\n\n51\n00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,620\n\"Splendid!\" said Cat, trying not to grin. \"I will expect you at eight o'clock.\"\n\n52\n00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,580\nAt eight the next evening Dog and Mouse knocked on Cat's door.\n\n53\n00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,040\nInside sat Lion,\n\n54\n00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,100\nso big he all but filled the house.\n\n55\n00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,920\nCat had to sit between his huge paws.\nCat was smiling.\n\n56\n00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,420\nIn the space remaining at one side was a table. It was covered with dishes of good things Cat had brought to please Lion.\n\n57\n00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,040\nThere were fresh-roasted peanuts;\n\n58\n00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,320\nfat, juicy raisins;\n\n59\n00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,960\nlittle cakes covered with sugar frosting;\n\n60\n00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,480\nbits of fried and crumbled bacon;\n\n61\n00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,360\nand a silver tray of mint candies.\n\n62\n00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:42,320\nCat looked up and whispered to Lion, \"When the door opens, I will grab Mouse, you grab Dog, and that will be that!\"\n\n63\n00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,780\n\"That!\" rumbled Lion, licking his whiskers with his rough, red tongue.\n\n64\n00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,880\n\"How prompt you are! Come in! Come in!\" cried Cat to Dog.\n\n65\n00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:03,200\nAs the door swung open, both Cat and Lion leaned forward, their mouths already open.\n\n66\n00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,940\nNeither of them had noticed that Dog and Mouse had brought their good friend, Wasp.\n\n67\n00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,520\nQuick as a wink, Wasp stung Lion's nose. Then his ear. Then his rough, red tongue. Lion was frantic!\n\n68\n00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,920\nHe tried to back away, but Cat's house was too tight around him.\n\n69\n00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,240\nWasp stung his lip.\n\n70\n00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,940\nLion broke the house apart and ran.\n\n71\n00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,820\nCat ran after him. And Dog after Cat.\n\n72\n00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,480\nCat's house was wrecked, but the table was unharmed.\n\n73\n00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,920\nAll the good things on it stood as they had been.\n\n74\n00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:43,960\n\"Good friend,\" said Mouse to Wasp, \"do help yourself to anything you fancy. Those little cakes, perhaps?\n\n75\n00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,080\nOr one of the mints? I rather like the smell of those peanuts, myself, for starters.\n\n76\n00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,940\nPlenty here for both of us, and a good share, too, for Dog, if Cat escapes what he deserves.\"\n\n77\n00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,160\nIf Cat did escape, you may be sure he never bothered Mouse again.\n\n78\n00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,960\nThe end.\n\n79\n00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,420\nWell I love that book, because it's very silly and very funny,\n\n80\n00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:21,320\nbut also because I think this book teaches us a good lesson about friendship. Actually, more than one lesson about friendship.\n\n81\n00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:31,700\nBut one of them is that it's important to have good friends around us because our good friends are our support system.\n\n82\n00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:41,140\nAnd our friends who love us will be there to protect us when things get rough, as they did for Mouse.\n\n83\n00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,940\nThanks for watching Storyline Online.

Listen.\n\n35\n00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,110\nHerbert's panting was kind of scary, but it wasn't enough for me.\n\n36\n00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,910\n\"Listen, Herbert, I'm sorry. I just don't think this is going to work.\n\n37\n00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,209\nIt's nothing personal, but I really need a monster with claws.\"\n\n38\n00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,500\n\"Picky, picky,\" Herbert complained.\n\n39\n00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,900\n\"As you wish.

We won, 11-10.”\n\n28\n00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,020\nMarcenia’s smile gleamed like the noonday\nsun as she shared the details of her victory.\n\n29\n00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,140\n“We won the game,” Marcenia said once\nmore.\n\n30\n00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,900\n“And you also ripped another dress,” Papa\nsaid, dismayed.\n\n31\n00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,560\nThen he kissed Marcenia’s cheek and turned off the light,\n\n32\n00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,780\nleaving her\nalone with the moonlight\n\n33\n00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,660\nand shadows and her dream of becoming a baseball player.\n\n34\n00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,640\nThe tiny house was still.\n\n35\n00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,900\nMarcenia could almost hear her mother’s needle and thread moving through the fabric\n\n36\n00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,460\nas she sat at the kitchen\ntable mending Marcenia’s dress.\n\n37\n00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,660\nAfter a while Marcenia heard Papa’s voice.\n\n38\n00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,400\n“I wish she would think about school as much as she thinks on baseball.”\n\n39\n00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,640\n“She wants to be a ballplayer when she grows\nup,” Mama said with a sad chuckle.\n\n40\n00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,960\n“I just want her to be happy.”\n\n41\n00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840\n“She’ll be what every other girl in this\nneighborhood will be,” Papa grumbled.\n\n42\n00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,240\n“A teacher, a nurse, or—“\n\n43\n00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,880\n“A maid,” Mama said softly.\n\n44\n00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340\n“I’m going to score three runs tomorrow,”\n\n45\n00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,820\nMarcenia promised the darkness as she clapped her hands over her ears.\n\n46\n00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,260\n“I’m going to hit a home run too.”\n\n47\n00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,260\nThen next day after school, Marcenia went\nto the playground.\n\n48\n00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,020\nThe other girls stayed on the hardtop to play hopscotch, jump rope, or jacks.\n\n49\n00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,660\nThe boys were huddled at the mound, talking quietly.\n\n50\n00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,600\nThey cast excited glances\n\n51\n00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,460\nat the man who was watching the field from the bleachers.\n\n52\n00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,000\n“Do you know who he is?” Harold asked\nMarcenia as she joined the group.\n\n53\n00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,660\nHe tipped his head toward the man.\n\n54\n00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,560\n“That there is Mr. Gabby Street. He’s\nrunning a baseball day camp this summer.”\n\n55\n00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,960\nMarcenia knew about Gabby Street. He was the manager for the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n56\n00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,620\nHe had led his Cardinals to the National League pennant in 1930,\n\n57\n00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,600\nand the Cardinals had topped that the next year by winning the 1931 World Series.\n\n58\n00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,980\n“What’s he want?” Marcenia asked.\n\n59\n00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,460\n“Kids for his baseball camp,” Harold said.\n“It’s going to be right here on this field\n\n60\n00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,720\nevery day except Sunday. Sundays are game days.”\n\n61\n00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,920\n“What is the cost?” Marcenia asked.\n\n62\n00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,080\n“It’s free! It’s free!” said Clarence.\n\n63\n00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,000\n“All you need is your own glove and baseball\ncleats,” Harold added.\n\n64\n00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,680\nMarcenia could hardly contain her excitement.\n\n65\n00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,700\nShe would do anything to be one of the players in Mr. Street’s camp!\n\n66\n00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,440\nThat afternoon Marcenia played with purpose.\n\n67\n00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,080\nShe scooped the grounders, catching them into her body to make sure they didn’t bounce away.\n\n68\n00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,180\nShe slid into second, keeping so low she wouldn’t be tagged.\n\n69\n00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,980\nShe kept her eyes on each pitch, waiting for a good one to send over the fence.\n\n70\n00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,080\nShe scored three runs just like she wanted\nand hit a homer.\n\n71\n00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,820\nWhen Mr. Street approached the players after the game, Marcenia crowded in close so he could see her.\n\n72\n00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,580\n“I just saw some good ball,” Mr. Street said, smiling.\n\n73\n00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,860\n“Who wants to come to my\nbaseball camp and really learn to play this game?”\n\n74\n00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,680\nEvery hand went up.\n\n75\n00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,120\nMr. Street shook them all. He shook Marcenia’s hand last.\n\n76\n00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,120\n“You’ve got a good arm, little miss, and you run fast,” he said.\n\n77\n00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,140\n“But I don’t take girls in my camp.”\n\n78\n00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,080\nMarcenia looked down so no one would see her disappointment.\n\n79\n00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,740\nShe began striking dust from her dress.\n\n80\n00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,980\n“Hey, Marcenia’s been playing ball with\nus since we were little kids,” Harold told Mr. Street.\n\n81\n00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,280\n“She’s the only player we got who ever\nsteals bases,” Clarence said.\n\n82\n00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,180\nMarcenia was pleased that her friends had\ncome to her defense,\n\n83\n00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,100\nbut Mr. Street didn’t change his mind.\n\n84\n00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,740\nAs she walked home, she thought\nabout how those very same boys had teased her\n\n85\n00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,580\nwhen she first started playing baseball\nwith them.\n\n86\n00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,640\nThen when they saw she could run, hit, and throw as well as they could,\n\n87\n00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,460\nthe teasing stopped. They had let her play.\n\n88\n00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,520\nMarcenia decided to give Mr. Street a reason\nto change his mind.\n\n89\n00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,360\nEveryday Marcenia played baseball, and everyday\nMr. Street refused to invite her to his camp.\n\n90\n00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,900\nThen came a day when Marcenia got tired of hearing him say, “I don’t take girls in my camp.”\n\n91\n00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,500\nThat day, when she was on third\nbase in the ninth inning of a tie game,\n\n92\n00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,160\nMarcenia decided to take the biggest chance in all\nbaseball. She decided to steal home.\n\n93\n00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,320\nWhen the pitcher drew back his arm to throw the ball to Harold,\n\n94\n00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,580\nMarcenia launched into motion.\n\n95\n00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,680\nThe catcher snared the pitch in his glove\nand ran toward Marcenia to tag her out.\n\n96\n00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,740\nMarcenia doubled back toward third. When the catcher\nthrew the ball back to the third baseman,\n\n97\n00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,160\nMarcenia turned and bolted toward home plate.\nAs the ball sailed above her head,\n\n98\n00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,100\nMarcenia pumped her arms and knees harder.\n\n99\n00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,300\nWith the ball speeding toward home, Marcenia\ndropped her weight and slid into home plate.\n\n100\n00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,540\nShe had stolen home and scored the winning run!\n\n101\n00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,900\nWhile her teammates celebrated their victory,\n\n102\n00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,800\nMarcenia planted her hands on her hips and faced Mr. Street.\n\n103\n00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,400\n“I am a baseball player,” she said. “I\nwant to learn to play this game as well as I can.\n\n104\n00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,880\nMay I come to your camp?”\n\n105\n00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,380\n“Well, little miss, if you can steal home,\nyou can probably do anything you set your mind to,”\n\n106\n00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,020\nMr. Street said.  “You can come to my camp as long as you have your own equipment.”\n\n107\n00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,300\nWhen Marcenia told her parents the good news about the camp that evening,\n\n108\n00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,120\nher father was not pleased.\n\n109\n00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,120\n“I don’t like you acting like such a tomboy,”\nhe said with a snap of his evening paper.\n\n110\n00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,500\n“Besides, you know we don’t have money\nto spend on—“\n\n111\n00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,220\n“The camp’s free!” Marcenia said excitedly.\n\n112\n00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,580\n“Equipment isn’t free,” Papa said.\n\n113\n00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,040\n“I have a glove,” Marcenia said. “Harold\ngave me his old one.”\n\n114\n00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,560\n“You’ll need cleats, and we don’t have\nmoney for those,” Papa added.\n\n115\n00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,220\n“So unless you’re prepared to get them yourself, I think you’ll have to forget about that camp.”\n\n116\n00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,800\nWith another snap of Papa’s newspaper, Marcenia\nfelt her dream move out of reach.\n\n117\n00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,580\nMr. Street was at the field the next time\nMarcenia played.\n\n118\n00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,560\nBefore the game, she mustered all her strength to keep from crying.\n\n119\n00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,260\n“Mr. Street,” she said, “I can’t come\nto your camp.\n\n120\n00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,400\nI don’t have cleats and my father says we can’t afford them. But thank you for inviting me.”\n\n121\n00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,700\nAlthough she was sad, Marcenia played as well\nas she always had.\n\n122\n00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,840\nShe loved baseball too much not to play with all  her heart.\n\n123\n00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,160\nUnable to sleep, Marcenia gazed through her\nwindow at the full moon glowing in the sky.\n\n124\n00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,080\nIt was so round and bright,\n\n125\n00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,300\nlike a brand new baseball.\n\n126\n00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,960\nShe reached to the floor and took up her baseball glove.\n\n127\n00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,600\nShe put it on and punched the pocket,\n\n128\n00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,840\nas if the moon would drop into  it like so many fly balls had before.\n\n129\n00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,460\nMarcenia wondered sadly if Papa was right.\nMaybe girls didn’t grow up to be ballplayers after all.\n\n130\n00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,640\nBut playing baseball was her dream,\nand Marcenia couldn’t imagine doing anything else.\n\n131\n00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,980\nThe next day after school Marcenia was the first one at the playing field.\n\n132\n00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,700\nMr. Street was already there, and he waved Marcenia over.\n\n133\n00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,940\n“You’re a good ballplayer, Marcenia,”\nhe said. “I want good ballplayers for my camp.”\n\n134\n00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,140\nHe handed Marcenia a box, and he watched as she opened it.\n\n135\n00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,520\nHer eyes widened as she pulled out a shoe with each hand.\n\n136\n00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,160\nThese weren’t\njust any shoes. These were real baseball cleats!\n\n137\n00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,020\n“Thank you, Mr. Street!” Marcenia was\nso excited she could barely squeeze out the words.\n\n138\n00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,100\nShe hugged the shoes to her chest.\nThey were even better than stealing home!\n\n139\n00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,080\n“Don’t you have a game to play?” Mr.\nStreet said, nodding toward the field.\n\n140\n00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,820\n“Yes, I do!” Marcenia replied happily.\n\n141\n00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,780\nHer fingers flew as she unbuckled her street shoes and laced on her new cleats.\n\n142\n00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,760\nThey fit perfectly. She ran in them. She jumped in them.\n\n143\n00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,740\nShe caught and slid in them. And she\nhit a home run in them.\n\n144\n00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,060\nAfter the game they boy rushed to Mr. Street, talking over one another about the game.\n\n145\n00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,060\nMarcenia lingered at home plate. She stared at her feet, proud of the new scuffs and smudges on her shoes.\n\n146\n00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,540\nThey had been a little stiff\nat first.\n\n147\n00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,580\nBut now that she had played a good game of baseball in them,\n\n148\n00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,020\nthe cleats were\nexactly the way she wanted them to be.\n\n149\n00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,780\nMr. Street excused himself from the crowd\nof boys.\n\n150\n00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,400\n“I look forward to seeing you in camp,” he said to Marcenia.\n\n151\n00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,700\nShe gave him a hopeful smile, but Marcenia\nknew she still had one more person to convince\n\n152\n00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,760\nbefore she could officially accept Mr. Street’s invitation.\n\n153\n00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,880\nShe ran home and waited anxiously for her\nfather to return from work.\n\n154\n00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,660\nAs soon as her father arrived, Marcenia showed\nhim her new cleats.\n\n155\n00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:13,340\n“Now, Marcenia, where… where did you get\nthose…where did you get those shoes?”\n\n156\n00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:19,480\nPapa asked sternly.\n“Mr. Street gave them to me,” Marcenia said.\n\n157\n00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,640\n“He wants me to come to his baseball camp.”\n\n158\n00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,200\nPapa looked down at Marcenia’s baseball\ncleats,\n\n159\n00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,140\nwhich were already scuffed and dusted with field dirt.\n\n160\n00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,420\n“You must be a pretty good ballplayer for an important man like Mr. Street\n\n161\n00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,940\nto buy you those shoes,” he admitted. Then he smiled.\n\n162\n00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,200\n“You know I don’t like charity, but I\nreckon we can’t give those shoes back in this state.\n\n163\n00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,040\nI’ll have to thank Mr. Street for his generosity when I take you down to that baseball camp.”\n\n164\n00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,820\nMarcenia could hardly believe her ears — Papa had agreed!\n\n165\n00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:56,380\nHer chest filled with joy and she threw her arms around her father, hugging him hard.\n\n166\n00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,060\n“You’ll see how good I am!” she cried.\n\n167\n00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:07,020\nMarcenia felt as proud and happy as if she reached right up in the sky and caught the moon in her glove.\n\n168\n00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,760\nShe was on her way to becoming a real baseball player. She would make her dream come true.\n\n169\n00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,800\nGood story. It’s a great story.\n\n170\n00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,160\nYou know what’s great about this story is it’s also, it’s also true.\n\n171\n00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,480\nThis little girl is real and grew up to be a professional baseball player.\n\n172\n00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:38,000\nDreams are, dreams are important.\nAnd sometimes you can find dreams in books.\n\n173\n00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,620\nThat’s what makes this story so special,\nyou know. It’s important to dream.\n\n174\n00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,920\nYou can be a lot of things in your life, not just a baseball player,\n\n175\n00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,480\nbut you can also be the person who wrote this book someday.\n\n176\n00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,880\nYou can be a doctor. You can be a lot of things.\n\n177\n00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,060\nThat’s what I love about books, you know, they take us to a place.\n\n178\n00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,280\nWe can read them in a car. We can read them in our room.\n\n179\n00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,900\nYou know, books can take you around the world and you never leave your house.\n\n180\n00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,640\nWhen I think of a lot of the great things that have come to be in my life,\n\n181\n00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,300\na lot of them have come from books just\nlike this.\n\n182\n00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,300\nI think if you start reading as young as you guys are, you’re gonna have a really great life.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,760\nWelcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,960\nI'm Justin Theroux, and today I will be reading Here Comes the Garbage Barge!\n\n3\n00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,280\nWritten by Jonah Winter and illustrated by Red Nose Studio.\n\n4\n00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,600\nGarbage. Big, heaping, stinking mounds of garbage.\n\n5\n00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,700\nBig bags of garbage on the sidewalk.\nGarbage trucks overflowing with garbage.\n\n6\n00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:35,620\nLandfills reaching up to the heavens with more and more garbage, garbage, garbage!\n\n7\n00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,140\nDid you know that the average American makes about four pounds of garbage every day?\n\n8\n00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,920\nWell, a while back, in the town of Islip, the average person made seven pounds of garbage every day.\n\n9\n00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,800\nIslip is a little town on Long Island, right near New York City, and Islip had a problem: garbage!\n\n10\n00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,840\nTo be exact: 3,168 tons of garbage. And nowhere to put it.\n\n11\n00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,500\nEnter the Garbage Barge!\n\n12\n00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,660\nSee, this guy in the garbage business named Gino Stroffolino came up with a brilliant plan:\n\n13\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,460\nA garbage barge would carry the Long Island garbage down to North Carolina.\n\n14\n00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,860\nMr. Stroffolino had a friend there, Joey LaMotta.\n\n15\n00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,360\n\"Everything is arranged,\" Joey'd told him. \"You bring me dat garbage-- I'll take care of it.\"\n\n16\n00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,420\nSome poor farmers would be paid to take the garbage and bury it on their farms. Clever, huh?\n\n17\n00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,560\nSo on March 22, 1987, all 3,168 tons of garbage was loaded up.\n\n18\n00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:46,160\nThen a little tugboat named the Break of Dawn began its long journey south, tugging the rusty old Garbage Barge behind it.\n\n19\n00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:54,220\nThe Break of Dawn was a happy little tugboat. Her captain and crew was Cap'm Duffy St. Pierre, a crusty old sailor.\n\n20\n00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,440\nTogether they tugged the Garbage Barge down the East Coast of America.\n\n21\n00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,720\n\"Toot toot,\" said the tugboat as it entered the harbor at Morehead City, North Carolina.\n\n22\n00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:11,160\nNorth Carolina. Land of sand dunes and pine trees, of Bar-B-Que and mountains and basketball...\n\n23\n00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,780\nSmelling something strange, two old sisters who lived on the beach ran out and got their binoculars.\n\n24\n00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,240\n\"Look!\" said Miss Alma McTiver. \"It's garbage!\"\n\n25\n00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,840\n\"In our beautiful harbor?\" said Miss Ida McTiver. \"What the hairy heck? That ain't right! Call the law!\"\n\n26\n00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,760\nSo a police boat went out to greet the Garbage Barge. It wasn't a friendly greeting.\n\n27\n00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,820\n\"You can't park that garbage in our harbor!\"\n\n28\n00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,000\n\"I've got orders to dock here and I'm gonna follow 'em!\" cried Cap'm Duffy.\n\n29\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,140\n\"I'm afraid you can't do that,\" said the policeman.\n\n30\n00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,880\n\"Well, blow me down...\" said Cap'm Duffy, scratching his whiskers. And he radioed his boss.\n\n31\n00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,380\n\"They don't want our garbage,\" Cap'm Duffy said to Gino Stroffolino. \"Where's that fella who was supposed to meet me?\"\n\n32\n00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,100\n\"Joey had a little accident,\" said Mr. Stroffolino. \"Just stay put while I make a coupla calls.\"\n\n33\n00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:10,060\nBut the minutes turned into hours turned into days-- just Cap'm Duffy with a barge full of garbage. It wasn't much company.\n\n34\n00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,700\nFinally, Mr. Stroffolino's voice came through on the radio. \"Bring dat garbage down to New Orleans,\" he said.\n\n35\n00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,700\n\"I know dis guy-- Tony Cafone. He'll take it.\"\n\n36\n00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,420\n\"Well, let those saints go marchin' in!\" shouted Cap'm Duffy. See, New Orleans was his hometown.\n\n37\n00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,160\nSurely folks back home would be happy to see him and his big load of garbage.\n\n38\n00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,520\n\"Ahoy!\" he called as they came within view of the city. \"Hard a-starboard! Thar she blows!\"\n\n39\n00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:48,900\nNew Orleans. Birthplace of jazz, home of blackened redfish and streets filled with music, friendly faces, streetcars, garbage...\n\n40\n00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,460\nThe mayor could see the Garbage Barge way off on the horizon. News of the wandering garbage had already reached him.\n\n41\n00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,840\n\"We've got enough of our own trash,\" he told his staff. \"Call the coast guard!\"\n\n42\n00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,580\nThe coast guard arrived just in time to stop the Garbage Barge from making its way up the mighty Mississippi.\n\n43\n00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,540\n\"Shiver me timbers,\" moaned Cap'm Duffy. \"You can't do this to a hometown boy!\"\n\n44\n00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,280\n\"Oh, yes we can,\" cried the coast guard. What could Cap'm Duffy say?\n\n45\n00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:25,720\n\"All righty then. Full speed backwards!\" he ordered himself.\n\"Aye-aye, Cap'm,\" he answered.\n\n46\n00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:34,260\nAnd, at dusk, the Break of Dawn and the tired old Garbage Barge began their sad journey back out to sea.\n\n47\n00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,940\nThere they were-- floating out in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. This was getting ridiculous.\n\n48\n00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:48,200\nWould no one take this garbage (which, by the way, was really starting to stink)?\n\n49\n00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,600\nCap'm Duffy radioed his boss.\n\n50\n00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:59,240\n\"Okay,\" said Gino Stroffolino. \"Dere's dis guy down in Mexico-- he owes me a favor. Goes by da name of John Smith. I'll tell him you're coming.\"\n\n51\n00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,120\n\"All righty, then,\" Cap'm Duffy grumbled. \"Southward ho.\"\n\n52\n00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:13,520\nMexico. Land of enchantment, of enchiladas and folk art, of swaying palm trees and moonlit beaches...\n\n53\n00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,520\nNews of the floating garbage barge had arrived before Cap'm Duffy.\n\n54\n00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,800\nAs the Garbage Barge approached Telchac Puerto, it was surrounded by the Mexican Navy.\n\n55\n00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,400\n\"¡Váyase!\" came a voice through a loudspeaker. \"¡Rápido!\"\n(That means \"Get moving fast!\" in Spanish.)\n\n56\n00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:37,140\nThese guys had guns. Cap'm Duffy had no choice. He turned his little tugboat around and, schlumped across the wheel, he headed back out to sea.\n\n57\n00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,680\n\"Where next?\" the captain asked Mr. Stroffolino.\n\n58\n00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:48,260\n\"Belize,\" said Mr. Stroffolino. \"It's a country. Next to Mexico. I know dis guy-- Rico D'Amico.\"\n\n59\n00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:55,440\nBelize. Land of bananas, of beautiful coral reefs, tropical flowers, and colorful birds...\n\n60\n00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,280\nPictures of the garbage barge had been on the local news. Cap'm Duffy had almost reached the dock when he saw a line of soliders waving their arms.\n\n61\n00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,220\n\"Kungo!\" they shouted.\n(Roughly translated, that means \"Fuhgeddaboudit!\")\n\n62\n00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,680\nSix weeks had passed since the Garbage Barge had set out, and the garbage was getting really funky.\n\n63\n00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,700\nNobody wanted it. And of course they didn't! It was somebody else's six-week-old garbage!\n\n64\n00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:25,300\nCap'm Duffy radioed Mr. Stroffolino once again.\n\"I can't take it anymore! I quit!\"\n\n65\n00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,760\n\"Okay, okay,\" said Mr. Stroffolino. \"Take da garbage back to Long Island. But I gotta coupla places you could try along da way.\"\n\n66\n00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,900\nTexas. The Lone Star State, home of cowbodys, cacti, cadillacs, and oil-- black gold, they call it...\n\n67\n00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,980\nThe Garbage Barge arrived in the harbor near Houston only to find some Texas Rangers in speedboats shaking their heads \"No!\"\n\n68\n00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,220\nNext stop, Florida.\n\n69\n00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:03,340\nThe Sunshine State. Home of alligators, beautiful beaches, oranges, and grandparents...\n\n70\n00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,340\nThe Garbage Barge was not welcome.\n\n71\n00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:18,100\nBy now, the Garbage Barge was famous. It had been on TV and in the headlines of all the papers. Comedians even told jokes about it.\n\n72\n00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:26,520\nBut as Cap'm Duffy and the Break of Dawn tugged it into New York Harbor, they were a sad sight.\n\n73\n00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,040\nCap'm Duffy's mouth hung open. The little tugboat forgot to toot.\n\n74\n00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,980\nAnd the Garbage Barge looked the saddest-- and smelled the smelliest-- of all.\n\n75\n00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:47,340\n\"Well, me mateys, here we are, back where we began,\" Cap'm Duffy sighed as his two boats finally pulled into Islip's harbor.\n\n76\n00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:53,340\nBut guess what? Islip had seen this coming. They refused to take the garbage.\n\n77\n00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,180\nAnd the garbage was not welcome anywhere on Long Island or in New Jersey or in New York City, either.\n\n78\n00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:08,300\nFor a whole summer, Cap'm Duffy and his little tugboat tugged the garbage around New York. What else could they do?\n\n79\n00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,040\n\"Look mom!\" kids would say. \"Here comes the Garbage Barge!\"\n\n80\n00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,820\nAs the summer days got hotter, the garbage grew beyond stinky. Someone had to take it-- they just had to.\n\n81\n00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:27,680\nThen, at last...\n\"Good news!\" said Gino Stroffolino when he radioed the tired old captain.\n\n82\n00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,580\n\"Here's da deal: Brooklyn's gonna take dat garbage and burn it. A judge told 'em dey had to. See, dey got dis 'incinerator.'\"\n\n83\n00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,680\n\"Aye-aye,\" mumbled Cap'm Duffy.\n\n84\n00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:49,400\nAnd on September 1, 1987, 162 days after the Garbage Barge had first set out, it reached its final harbor.\n\n85\n00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:58,120\nBrooklyn. Former home of the Dodgers, current home of synagogues and mosques and greasy diners with breakfast specials...\n\n86\n00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:08,360\n3,168 tons of garbage was unloaded by cranes, put onto trucks, and hauled to the incinerator.\n\n87\n00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:16,440\nIt burned for hours, and when it was done, it only weighed 430 tons.\n\n88\n00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:26,480\nThen it was hauled off and buried in a landfill in Islip. The town had been forced by the judge to take back what was left of its stinking garbage.\n\n89\n00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,360\nJustice!\n\n90\n00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:37,320\nThe Break of Dawn and Cap'm Duffy were free to go back to New Orleans. As they steered out to sea, people waved and took pictures.\n\n91\n00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:45,340\n\"It's a fair wind and open sea, me hearties!\" the crusty old captain shouted, and he patted the tugboat on its wheel.\n\n92\n00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:54,420\nTogether they had traveled over 6,000 miles, tugging the unloved Garbage Barge. It was time to go home.\n\n93\n00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340\nThe end.\n\n94\n00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,540\nSo the moral of the story is don't make so much garbage, guys.\n\n95\n00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,700\nAnd if you do make garbage, don't try and get other people to clean it up for you.\n\n96\n00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,040\n'Cause all that garbage has to go somewhere.\n\n97\n00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,800\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.

Kiernan Shipka and today I'm going to be reading you\n\n4\n00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,960\nThe House That Jane Built written by Tanya Lee Stone and illustrated by Kathryn Brown.\n\n5\n00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,820\nI'm very excited to be reading this to you all.\n\n6\n00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,060\nA house stands on a busy street\n\n7\n00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,060\nIts doors are opened wide, To all who come it bids good cheer,\n\n8\n00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,020\nTo some it says, Abide.\n\n9\n00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,860\nIn 1889, a wealthy young woman named Jane Addams\n\n10\n00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,740\nmoved into a lovely, elegant house in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n11\n00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,620\nBut instead of moving into a lovely, elegant neighborhood,\n\n12\n00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,000\nshe picked a house that was smack in the middle of one of the filthiest, poorest parts of town.\n\n13\n00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,360\nWhy would a wealthy young woman do this when she could have lived anywhere?\n\n14\n00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,520\nJane was just six years old when she went on a trip with her father\n\n15\n00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,020\nand noticed that not everyone lived like her family did.\n\n16\n00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,320\nShe vowed that one day she would live\n\n17\n00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,920\n“right in the midst of horrid little houses” and find a way to fix the world.\n\n18\n00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,160\nJane was a strong soul from the start.\n\n19\n00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,940\nAnd she was brave.\n\n20\n00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,080\nWhen she and her stepbrother George were young,\n\n21\n00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,580\nthey would sneak away at night to explore in nearby caves.\n\n22\n00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,580\nOnce, Jane lowered George over a cliff\n\n23\n00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,960\non a rope to spy on an owl in its nest.\n\n24\n00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880\nJane was smart.\n\n25\n00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,480\nShe read and read from her father’s book collection,\n\n26\n00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,120\nwhich doubled as the town library.\n\n27\n00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,500\nMost girls did not go to college then,\n\n28\n00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,700\nbut Jane’s father believed women should be educated.\n\n29\n00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,720\nShe went to Rockford Female Seminary\n\n30\n00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,800\nand graduated at the top of her class.\n\n31\n00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,400\nBut when school was over, she wasn’t sure what to do with her life.\n\n32\n00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,840\nThat same summer, her father died.\n\n33\n00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,360\nJane was lost.\n\n34\n00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,140\nAbout two years later, she and her friends traveled to Europe.\n\n35\n00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,680\nThey went to the theater, the opera, and many beautiful places.\n\n36\n00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,680\nBut then Jane saw something in London she couldn’t forget:\n\n37\n00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,740\npeople in ragged clothes with outstretched hands,\n\n38\n00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,100\nbegging a cart vendor to buy his leftover rotten fruits and vegetables\n\n39\n00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,440\nthat hadn’t sold at market.\n\n40\n00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,240\nThe spoiled food was all they could afford.\n\n41\n00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,840\nWhat could she do to help?\n\n42\n00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,900\nLong after her trip was over, the question stuck in her mind.\n\n43\n00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,880\nShe remembered how she felt when she was six.\n\n44\n00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,000\nJane traveled back to London to learn about\n\n45\n00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,760\na place she had heard was helping the poor in a brand-new way.\n\n46\n00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,540\nAt Toynbee Hall, the idea was to have rich and poor people live together\n\n47\n00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,420\nin the same community and learn from each other.\n\n48\n00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,140\nInstead of simply serving soup, for example, people could take cooking classes.\n\n49\n00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,780\nOther skills were taught as well.\n\n50\n00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,420\nToynbee Hall was the first settlement house.\n\n51\n00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,700\nIt was called a settlement house because\n\n52\n00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,100\nthe well-off people who worked there during the day\n\n53\n00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,500\ndidn’t go back to their own homes at night.\n\n54\n00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,560\nInstead, they “settled” in and lived at Toynbee Hall,\n\n55\n00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,840\nright in the same neighborhood as the needy.\n\n56\n00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,960\nJane now knew what to do.\n\n57\n00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680\nShe told her friend Ellen Gates Starr\n\n58\n00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,060\nabout her plan to build a settlement house in Chicago.\n\n59\n00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,680\nIt was “as if a racehorse had burst out of the gate,\n\n60\n00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,380\nfree at last to pour every ounce of energy into running.”\n\n61\n00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,440\nThere was a glittery side to Chicago,\n\n62\n00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,840\nwith its mansions, fancy shops, and sparkling lakefront.\n\n63\n00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,020\nBut there was a gritty side, too.\n\n64\n00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,600\nOne million people lived in Chicago in 1889.\n\n65\n00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,820\nMost were immigrants — people who came from other\ncountries.\n\n66\n00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,920\nThey came for a better life, but they didn’t speak English.\n\n67\n00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,940\nThat made it hard to find good jobs. Many needed help.\n\n68\n00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,700\nJane found the perfect house.\n\n69\n00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,840\nIt had big rooms with high ceilings and\nmarble fireplaces.\n\n70\n00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,440\nAnd it was in one of the worst neighborhoods in the city.\n\n71\n00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920\nGarbage lay rotting in the streets, piled high.\n\n72\n00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,220\nLarge families were crammed into tiny, ramshackle houses with no running water.\n\n73\n00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,760\nThe smell from back-lot outhouses hung in the air.\n\n74\n00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,380\nRough boys ran the streets, stirring up trouble because they had nothing to do.\n\n75\n00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,780\nThe house had belonged to Charles J. Hull,\n\n76\n00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,680\nand he had left it to a wealthy cousin named Helen Culver.\n\n77\n00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,300\nAt first, Jane paid rent, but after she told Helen what she had in mind,\n\n78\n00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,640\nHelen gave her the house for free.\n\n79\n00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,940\nIn thanks, Jane named it Hull House.\n\n80\n00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,740\nJane moved in on September 18, 1889.\n\n81\n00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,560\nThe very first night, she was so busy and excited\n\n82\n00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,300\nthat she forgot to lock a side door before going to sleep.\n\n83\n00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,640\nBut no one broke in.\n\n84\n00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,720\nShe decided to leave Hull House unlocked from then on\n\n85\n00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,720\nso people would know they could come in at any time.\n\n86\n00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,340\nPeople who didn’t have enough to eat or had no shoes on their feet\n\n87\n00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,340\nor had just lost a job began to find their way to Hull House.\n\n88\n00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,420\nOf course, it wasn’t always peaceful.\n\n89\n00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,840\nOnce, a couple of boys threw rocks at the house and broke a window.\n\n90\n00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,220\nInstead of getting upset, Jane took it as a sign\n\n91\n00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,840\nto give the neighborhood kids something to do.\n\n92\n00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,020\nShe had her own way of looking at things.\n\n93\n00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,360\nAnother time, Jane discovered a man in the\nhouse looking for something to steal.\n\n94\n00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,520\nHe tried to jump out a window to escape,\n\n95\n00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,800\nbut she showed him the door so he wouldn’t get hurt.\n\n96\n00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,560\nWhen he broke in a second time, she asked him why.\n\n97\n00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,220\nHe said he was out of work and had no money.\n\n98\n00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,060\nJane told him to report back the next morning.\n\n99\n00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,320\nWhen he did, she gave him a job.\n\n100\n00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,480\nJane spent her own money running Hull House,\n\n101\n00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,040\nand asked other well-off people to donate, too.\n\n102\n00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,780\nShe did not want to be paid for working there.\n\n103\n00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,540\nEven when people gave her gifts, she gave them away.\n\n104\n00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,340\nHer friends teased Jane about this.\n\n105\n00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,980\nOne friend gave her new underwear with her initials on them just so Jane couldn’t pass them on.\n\n106\n00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,880\nBut she did!\n\n107\n00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,780\nAny problem Jane discovered, she tackled.\n\n108\n00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,300\nNo running water in houses meant no easy way to bathe.\n\n109\n00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,920\nThis led to sickness. So Jane put in a public bath.\n\n110\n00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,420\nPeople flocked to it, which helped her convince city officials\n\n111\n00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,980\nthey needed to build more public baths.\n\n112\n00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,700\nNo safe place for children to play?\n\n113\n00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,920\nJane talked a wealthy man into giving her the lot he owned near Hull House.\n\n114\n00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,760\nWorkmen tore down the shabby buildings\n\n115\n00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,980\nand turned the lot into a playground. \nIt was the first one in Chicago!\n\n116\n00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,800\nLittle kids home alone because their\nparents had to work fourteen hours a day?\n\n117\n00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,660\nJane started a morning kindergarten and after-school clubs.\n\n118\n00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,480\nShe also set up afternoon classes for older kids\n\n119\n00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,660\nwho had to go to work during the school day.\n\n120\n00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,740\nJane did not do all this alone.\n\n121\n00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,620\nEllen Gates Starr was her partner from the start.\n\n122\n00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,400\nMany other smart, generous people moved into Hull House and helped.\n\n123\n00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,500\nThey taught literature, art, English, math, science, and cooking.\n\n124\n00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,320\nSoon there was not just one building, but two.\n\n125\n00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,860\nThen three, and four, and more.\n\n126\n00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,000\nBy 1907, Hull House had grown into thirteen buildings,\n\n127\n00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,980\nincluding a gymnasium, coffee house, theatre, music school, community kitchen, and an art gallery.\n\n128\n00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,560\nBy the early 1920s, more than nine thousand people a week visited Hull House.\n\n129\n00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,160\nThe house that Jane built brought all kinds of people together and helped those in need.\n\n130\n00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,420\nIt changed a bad neighborhood into a great and strong community.\n\n131\n00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,220\nHull House transformed the lives of all who stepped inside.\n\n132\n00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,780\nToday, every community center in America,\n\n133\n00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,480\nin large part, has Jane Addams to thank.\n\n134\n00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,280\nWith all that she did, both inside and outside the house\nthat Jane built,\n\n135\n00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,360\nher childhood wish to help fix the world came true.\n\n136\n00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,180\nAnd the cool part about this story which I love so much\n\n137\n00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,920\nis that its true.\n\n138\n00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,860\nReading is so magical for so many reasons.\n\n139\n00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,660\nIt can bring you to amazing, magical places\n\n140\n00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,660\nthat are beyond your wildest dreams,\n\n141\n00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,760\nbut it can also give you amazing, valuable,  inspiring information like this\n\n142\n00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,840\nand I'm so happy this book exists and that I got to learn\n\n143\n00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,760\na little bit more about Jane today because\n\n144\n00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,330\nshe makes me want to be a better person.\n\n145\n00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,400\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n146\n00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,040\nMake sure you check out all our other videos.\n\n147\n00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,340\nKeep watching and keep reading",

I'm Bonnie Bartlett.\n--And I'm Bill Daniels.\n\n2\n00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,220\nAnd we're here reading for SAG's BookPALS.\n\n3\n00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,620\nWe're doing a story today called \"Knots on a Counting Rope.\"\n\n4\n00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,240\nAnd it was written by Bill Martin, Jr. and John Archambault. It was illustrated by Ted Rand.\n\n5\n00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,340\nTell me the story again, Grandfather. Tell me who I am.\n\n6\n00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,660\nI have told you many times, Boy. You know the story by heart.\n\n7\n00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,220\nBut it sounds better when you tell it, Grandfather.\n\n8\n00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,480\nThen listen carefully. This may be the last telling.\n\n9\n00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,820\nNo, no, Grandfather. There will never be a last time. Promise me that. Promise me.\n\n10\n00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,840\nI promise you nothing, Boy. I love you. That is better than a promise.\n\n11\n00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,540\nAnd I love you, Grandfather, but tell me the story again. Please.\n\n12\n00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,120\n--Once there was a boy child... \n--No, Grandfather. Start at the beginning.\n\n13\n00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,780\nStart where the storm was crying my name.\n\n14\n00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,060\nYou know the story, Boy. Tell it.\n\n15\n00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,630\nNo, Grandfather, no. Start, \"It was a dark night...\"\n\n16\n00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:17,740\nIt was a dark night, a strange night. Your mother and father and I were safe in the hogan--\n\n17\n00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,800\n--and the sheep were safe in the pen,\n\n18\n00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,260\nWhen a wild storm came out of the mountains,\n\n19\n00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,100\nCrying, \"Boy-eeeeeeee!  Boyeeeeee!\"\n\n20\n00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,580\nAnd your mother said, \"I hear it in the wounded wind. A boy child will be born tonight.\"\n\n21\n00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,460\nThen what happened, Grandfather?\n\n22\n00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:49,480\nI rode up the canyon fast, to bring the grandmother. It is not a good sign for a child to be born without a grandmother's blessing.\n\n23\n00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,520\nWas the wind still calling for me, Grandfather?\n\n24\n00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:03,610\nYes, Boy, it was whipping up sand as sharp as claws, and crying like a bobcat, \"Boy-eeeeee!  Boy-eeeeeee!\"\n\n25\n00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,460\nWere you afraid, Grandfather?\n\n26\n00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,870\nI was much afraid.\n\n27\n00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,219\nHow much afraid?\n\n28\n00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,409\nHeart-pounding afraid, Boy.\n\n29\n00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:15,849\nThen what happened, Grandfather? Just as I was born. Tell me that part.\n\n30\n00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:28,159\nIt was strange...  strange. Just as you came forth and made your first cry, the wind stopped howling and the storm was over.\n\n31\n00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,209\nAnd the night became as quiet as soft falling snow.\n\n32\n00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:38,800\nThe grandmother took you up in her arms, and said, \"He will walk in beauty.\n\n33\n00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,119\nTo the east, to the west, to the north, to the south, he will walk in beauty...\n\n34\n00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,100\n...forever.\" And I was born strong, wasn't I, Grandfather?\n\n35\n00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,060\nNo, you were not strong. You were sick and frail. We thought you would die.\n\n36\n00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,060\nBut I didn't die, did I? Tell me about that, Grandfather.\n\n37\n00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:05,660\nAll night you lay silent with your eyes closed, your breath too shallow, too weak for crying.\n\n38\n00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:11,920\nAnd you carried me out to see the morning, Grandfather, but I did not open my eyes. Tell me that part.\n\n39\n00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,960\nTwo great blue horses came galloping by,\n\n40\n00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,440\nAnd they stopped, Grandfather! They stopped and looked at me.\n\n41\n00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:29,200\nAnd you raised your arms to the great blue horses and I said, \"See how the horses speak to him. They are his brothers from--\n\n42\n00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:37,080\n--from beyond the dark mountains. This boy child will not die.\" That is what you said, isn't it, Grandfather?\n\n43\n00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,820\nYes, Boy, that is what I said.\n\n44\n00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,939\n\"This boy child will not die. The great blue horses have given him the strength to live.\"\n\n45\n00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,000\nAnd that is when you named me, isn't it, Grandfather?\n\n46\n00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,579\nAfter you smiled your first smile, we had the naming ceremony. All of the grandmothers and grandfathers were there.\n\n47\n00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,360\nAnd you named me Boy-Strength-of-Blue-Horses.\n\n48\n00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,040\nIt is a strong name.\n\n49\n00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,600\nDid I need a strong name, Grandfather?\n\n50\n00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,679\nAll children need a strong name to help them grow strong.\n\n51\n00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,429\nAnd I grew strong, didn't I?\n\n52\n00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:23,060\nYes, Boy-Strength-of-Blue-Horses, and each day you are growing stronger. You are learning to cross the dark mountains.\n\n53\n00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,680\nI already have crossed some of the dark mountains.\n\n54\n00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:33,000\nThere will be more, Boy. Dark mountains are always around us. They have no beginnings and--\n\n55\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,240\n--they have no endings. But we know they are there, Grandfather, when we suddenly feel afraid.\n\n56\n00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,200\nYes, Boy... afraid to do what we have to do.\n\n57\n00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,140\nWill I always have to live in the dark?\n\n58\n00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,740\nYes, Boy. You were born with a dark curtain in front of your eyes.\n\n59\n00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,040\nBut there are many ways to see, Grandfather.\n\n60\n00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:02,960\nYes, Boy, you are learning to see through your darkness because you have the strength of blue horses.\n\n61\n00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,060\nI can see the horses with my hands, Grandfather, but I cannot see the blue. What is blue?\n\n62\n00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,520\nYou know morning, Boy.\n\n63\n00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,860\nYes, I can feel morning. Morning throws off the blanket of night.\n\n64\n00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,120\nAnd you know sunrise.\n\n65\n00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,540\nYes, I hear sunrise, in the song of the birds.\n\n66\n00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,100\nAnd you know sky, Boy.\n\n67\n00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:32,520\nYes, sky touches my face, soft, like lambs' wool, and I breathe its softness.\n\n68\n00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:42,220\nBlue is all of these things. Blue is the feeling of a spring day beginning. Try. Try to see it, Boy.\n\n69\n00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:52,520\nBlue? Blue? Blue is the morning, the sunrise, the sky, the song of the birds...\n\n70\n00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,280\nI see it! Blue! Blue!\n\n71\n00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,940\nBlue is happiness, Grandfather, I feel it! I feel it in my heart!\n\n72\n00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,800\nThere was a sweep of blue in the rainbow, Boy, that morning your horse was born.\n\n73\n00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:14,299\nOh, tell me that part, Grandfather! I could not see the rainbow but I can still feel its happiness.\n\n74\n00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:19,919\nI awakened you, Boy, during the night, remember, just before the foal was born.\n\n75\n00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,020\nAnd you said to me, \"Come, Boy, Circles is ready to foal. The colt will be yours.\"\n\n76\n00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,580\nIt was a long night of cold rain--\n\n77\n00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,320\n--and we put a blanket over Circles, Grandfather, to keep her warm.\n\n78\n00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,740\nYes, Boy. As the sun came through the clouds, the foal was born--\n\n79\n00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,340\n--and a rainbow danced across the sky.\n\n80\n00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,840\nIt was a good sign, Boy.\n\n81\n00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,660\nAnd I named the little wet foal Rainbow!\n\n82\n00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,840\nYou have trained her well, Boy.\n\n83\n00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,600\n--Rainbow is smart, Grandfather.\n--Like you.\n\n84\n00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,660\nShe is good at remembering.\n\n85\n00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:59,680\nRainbow is my eyes, Grandfather. She takes me to the sheep, wherever they are, and when I am ready, she finds the way home.\n\n86\n00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,380\nNo one thought you could teach her to race, Boy.\n\n87\n00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:10,620\nBut I did, Grandfather! Every day, day after day, we followed you along the trail... And you let me hold the reins.\n\n88\n00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,540\nYou traced the trails in your mind, Boy, both you and Rainbow.\n\n89\n00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,480\nYes, Grandfather, we learned the trails by heart. Up South Mountain to Granite Rock,\n\n90\n00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:27,420\ndown the steep shortcut to Meadow-of-Blue-Flowers,  then straight across the Red Flats to Lightning-Split-Tree,\n\n91\n00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,040\nthen down the Switchbacks to the Canyon Trail, and on around to the finish line.\n\n92\n00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:38,860\nI learned from Rainbow when to turn by the pull of her neck and by counting her gallops.\n\n93\n00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,440\nNow tell me again about the race, Grandfather.\n\n94\n00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,140\nIt was a tribal day, Boy. You and the other boys were at the starting line, but you pulled back.\n\n95\n00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:55,220\nI was afraid, Grandfather, until you called to me. Tell me again what you said.\n\n96\n00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,100\nI said, \"Don't be afraid, Boy! Trust your darkness! Go like the wind!\"\n\n97\n00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:07,700\nAnd I leaned forward on Rainbow's neck. I grabbed her mane tight, and I said, \"Go, Rainbow, go!\"\n\n98\n00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,300\nI could feel the pushing and crowding and galloping thunder all around me.\n\n99\n00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:19,080\nRainbow and I went twisting, turning, galloping, galloping, galloping, counting the gallops, remembering the way.\n\n100\n00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,600\nAnd what did the people say, Grandfather?\n\n101\n00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,360\nThey said, \"Who is that boy riding bareback, racing the race with all of his heart?\"\n\n102\n00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:35,500\nAnd you said, \"That is Boy-Strength-of-Blue-Horses. He and his horse are together like one.\"\n\n103\n00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,880\nYes, Boy, that is what I said.\n\n104\n00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,580\nBut I didn't win, Grandfather.\n\n105\n00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,480\nNo, but you rode like the wind.\n\n106\n00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,760\nThe wind is my friend, Grandfather. It throws back my hair and laughs in my face.\n\n107\n00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,380\nYou see the wind better than I, Boy.\n\n108\n00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,040\nI finished the race, hot and dusty, sweat dripping from my face.\n\n109\n00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,060\nAnd you were smiling, Boy!\n\n110\n00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,700\nI wasn't afraid, Grandfather. I could see through the dark every turn of the race. Rainbow and I knew the way.\n\n111\n00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,460\nYou were crossing dark mountains, Boy!\n\n112\n00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,650\nTell me again what you told me then. I like to hear it over and over.\n\n113\n00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:19,060\nI said, \"Boy-Strength-of-Blue-Horses, you have raced darkness and won!\n\n114\n00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:27,700\nYou now can see with your heart, feel a part of all that surrounds you. Your courage lights the way.\"\n\n115\n00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,600\nAnd what did the grandmothers say?\n\n116\n00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,660\nYou tell me, Boy.  I know you remember.\n\n117\n00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:45,260\nYes, I remember, Grandfather. They said, \"This boy walks in beauty. His dreams are more beautiful than rainbows and sunsets.\"\n\n118\n00:09:50,420 --> 00:10:00,060\nNow, Boy... now that the story has been told again, I will tie another knot in the counting rope.\n\n119\n00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:08,960\nWhen the rope is filled with knots, you will know the story by heart and can tell it to yourself.\n\n120\n00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,520\nSo that I will grow stronger, Grandfather?\n\n121\n00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,200\nYes, stronger. Strong enough to cross the dark mountains.\n\n122\n00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,240\nI always feel strong when you are with me, Grandfather.\n\n123\n00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,600\nI will not always be with you, Boy.\n\n124\n00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,640\nNo Grandfather, don't ever leave me. What will I do without you?\n\n125\n00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:36,440\nYou will never be alone, Boy. My love will always surround you... with the strength of blue horses.\n\n126\n00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,500\nThat's a fun story. I hope you enjoyed it. We had fun.\n\n127\n00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,200\nYes we did. See you.",

A tale of regret.\n\n7\n00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,140\nA story that has not quite started yet. \nNow here is \"Romeow & Drooliet.\"\n\n8\n00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,700\nBenny, Marky and Romeow were brothers, and the best of friends.\n\n9\n00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,440\nOne fine morning, they were taking a break from their naps.\n\n10\n00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,320\n\"I'm bored,\" said Benny with a yawn.\n\n11\n00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,100\n\"Let's go to the park,\" said Marky.\n\n12\n00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,000\n\"What for?\" asked Benny.\n\n13\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,560\n\"To look for trouble,\" replied Marky.\n\n14\n00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,740\n\"No,\" said Romeow, dreamily, \"to look for love.\"\n\n15\n00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,720\n\"Yuck,\" said Benny and Marky, \"go back to sleep.\"\n\n16\n00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,220\nBut Romeow was already on his way out the door with his tail held high.\n\n17\n00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,620\nThe park was a great place for adventure. There were trees to climb, birds to chase and dogs to watch.\n\n18\n00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,900\n\"Let's head to the off-leash area,\" Marky suggested.\n\n19\n00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,740\n\"Can't catch me,\" he caterwauled to a large husky trapped behind the fence.\n\n20\n00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,280\n\"What do you think,\" he asked Romeow, \"should we play Dodge Dog?\"\n\n21\n00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,560\nJust as Romeow was about to reply, a carnivorous canine charged the cats.\n\n22\n00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200\nThe hot-headed dog barked, snapped and nearly jumped the fence.\n\n23\n00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,880\n\"Here, Turbo,\" someone called. \"Come on, boy.\"\n\n24\n00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,900\nTurbo reluctanly left, and the cats decided that they should, too.\n\n25\n00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,060\n\"That was a close one,\" said Benny.\n\n26\n00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,450\n\"Marky, one of these days you're going to get us into a lot of trouble,\" Romeow said, scowling.\n\n27\n00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,300\n\"Come on guys!\" Marky replied. \"There's a costume party in the neighborhood tonight.\n\n28\n00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,119\nI hear they are having barbecued salmon and grilled shrimp.\n\n29\n00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,960\nShall we groom ourselves? What do you say?\"\n\n30\n00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,000\n\"I say we go home and get ready,\" Benny cheered.\n\n31\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,340\n\"Okay, Marky, but no tricks,\" Romeow warned.\n\n32\n00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,200\nBack at the Felini house, the cats dug through bags and drawers.\n\n33\n00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,400\nWhen they were done, the room was as messy as a litter box.\n\n34\n00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,680\nDressed in their flashy finery, they streaked out the door like lightning and bolted into the night.\n\n35\n00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,360\nIt was easy to find the party.\n\n36\n00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,380\nThrongs of revelers, sounds of laughter and music and delicious smells spilled into the street.\n\n37\n00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,780\n\"But that's the house of the cat-hating Barkers,\" Romeow protested.\n\n38\n00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,580\n\"The sign says All Welcome,\" said Marky. \"Besides, we're disguised.\"\n\n39\n00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,800\n\"And I smell fish,\" Benny purred.\n\n40\n00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800\n\"I smell trouble,\" Romeow mumbled, looking at Marky.\n\n41\n00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:04,300\nBut the Felini felines followed their noses. At least Benny and Marky did. Romeow followed his eyes.\n\n42\n00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,840\nGazing across the room, he thought he saw an angel. As he got closer, he felt warm all over.\n\n43\n00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,780\nShe was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.\n\n44\n00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,519\n\"May I have this dance?\" Romeow nervously asked. He was delighted when she gave him her paw.\n\n45\n00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,660\nAs they danced, Romeow smiled. She smiled back.\n\n46\n00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,460\nThey twirled and dipped. The room spun.\n\n47\n00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,240\nRomeow had never felt so happy. He looked at her collar.\n\n48\n00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,100\n\"Drooliet, now there's a name that I'd drool over anytime,\" he said.\n\n49\n00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,120\n\"And what shall I call you?\" Drooliet panted.\n\n50\n00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:50,819\nBut before Romeow could answer, Turbo, the terror from the park, growled from out of nowhere, \"You can call him a freeloading Felini cat!\n\n51\n00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,560\nNow scram before this party turns into a kitty catastrophe.\"\n\n52\n00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,979\n\"My name is Romeow,\" Romeow called as he escaped. \"We shall meet again, dear Drooliet.\"\n\n53\n00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,320\n\"Not if I can help it,\" Turbo barked.\n\n54\n00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,440\n\"Good boy,\" said the Barkers.\n\n55\n00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,780\nRomeow drifted through the Barkers' yard in a dreamy fog. He couldn't get Drooliet out of his mind.\n\n56\n00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,889\nThen suddenly, he heard her voice coming from a balcony above.\n\n57\n00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:23,940\n\"Oh, Romeow, where is that fur-faced Romeow? I do not care that you are a cat or a Felini.\n\n58\n00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,440\nIf you were a creature of any other name, it would still make my tail wag.\"\n\n59\n00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,479\nWith a running start, Romeow jumped onto the balcony and landed next to Drooliet.\n\n60\n00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,320\n\"Call me any name you want,\" Romeow purred, \"Just call me yours.\"\n\n61\n00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:47,120\nThat moonlit night, cat and dog fell in love.\nThey had no cares, just the stars up above.\n\n62\n00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:52,849\nRomeow licked Drooliet on her face.\nHis whiskers tickled but she smiled with grace.\n\n63\n00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:58,200\n\"We shall be married,\" said young Romeow. \"I will be with you forever, starting now.\n\n64\n00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,400\nMeet me at the church. Sneak out of your house.\n\n65\n00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,640\nThere we will be wed by Mousignor Mouse.\"\n\n66\n00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,340\nBut will the world accept what happened next to our dear Romeow and Drooliet?\n\n67\n00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,620\nThey met the next day in front of the church. Romeow took Drooliet to a small chamber in the back.\n\n68\n00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,260\nMousignor Mouse entered, his robes flowing, his tail trailing.\n\n69\n00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,960\n\"Are you ready to be joined together as husband and wife?\" he squeaked.\n\n70\n00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,509\n\"I will love you and fetch you anything you desire,\" Drooliet promised Romeow.\n\n71\n00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:35,500\n\"I will love you and groom you even if I get hairballs,\" Romeow promised Drooliet.\n\n72\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,760\n\"You may lick the bride,\" pronounced Mousignor Mouse.\n\n73\n00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,500\nHappily married, Romeow and Drooliet went for a walk in the park.\n\n74\n00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,740\nThe sky seemed bluer, the sun seemed brighter.\n\n75\n00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,939\nSuddenly a large dark shadow ran towards them. It was Turbo!\n\n76\n00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,400\n\"Drooliet, we've been looking for you. What are you doing with that cat?\" he howled.\n\n77\n00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,640\n\"And you, Felini cat, will soon be puppy chow.\"\n\n78\n00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,040\n\"Let's not fight,\" Romeow pleaded with Turbo, \"We are family now.\"\n\n79\n00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,280\n\"No cat is kin to me,\" Turbo bellowed.\n\n80\n00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:17,400\nA crowd started to form. The Barkers arrived out of breath. Benny and Marky ran to Romeow's side.\n\n81\n00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,669\n\"This is foolish,\" Benny told Romeow, \"She's a dog. She's not worth it.\"\n\n82\n00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,439\nMarky hissed at Turbo, \"Roll over and play dead, fleabag.\"\n\n83\n00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,999\nTurbo exploded and attacked Marky.\n\n84\n00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,920\n\"Stop,\" cried Romeow, \"It's me that you want.\"\n\n85\n00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,240\nRomeow drew his claws as Marky crawled away to lick his wounds.\n\n86\n00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,880\nWith all his might, Romeow swiped at Turbo's snarling, snapping, massive muzzle.\n\n87\n00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,599\nIn seconds, Turbo sank to the ground with barely a whimper.\n\n88\n00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,480\n\"Cat got your tongue?\" Benny taunted.\n\n89\n00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,539\nRomeow wanted to run to Drooliet, but all of a sudden he was grabbed from above.\n\n90\n00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,820\n\"Okay, stray, you're coming with me,\" said Officer Prince, the animal control warden.\n\n91\n00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,500\n\"And get that dog on a leash,\" he yelled at the Barkers.\n\n92\n00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,940\nRomeow turned to see what was happening to Turbo, but it wasn't Turbo he was talking about.\n\n93\n00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,879\nTurbo was sitting quietly with his tail between his legs.\n\n94\n00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,500\nIt was Drooliet!  Before the Barkers could collar her, Drooliet took off running.\n\n95\n00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,560\nAs the animal control truck sped off with Romeow held prisoner inside, everyone scrambled out of the park.\n\n96\n00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,340\nThe Felinis pursued the van.  The Barkers chased after Drooliet.\n\n97\n00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,980\nAnd Benny and Marky took shortcuts through back alleys.\n\n98\n00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,040\nThe truck skidded to a stop at its dreaded destination.\n\n99\n00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,020\nThere was a huge commotion as people, cats, and dog arrived.\n\n100\n00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:57,860\nOfficer Prince opened the door to Romeow's cage. A split second later Romeow spied Drooliet across the street.\n\n101\n00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,700\nShe didn't even look for traffic before she crossed.\n\n102\n00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,780\nBefore Romeow could call out to her, he heard the worst sounds of his life.\n\n103\n00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,960\nFirst there was screeching, then a dull thud and last a silence as big as the universe.\n\n104\n00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,040\nEveryone looked on in disbelief.\n\n105\n00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,460\nDrooliet lay motionless in the middle of the street.  No one moved.  Then Romeow ran towards her.\n\n106\n00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,020\n\"Drooliet,\" Romeow cried, \"my love, my wife.\"\n\n107\n00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,980\n\"His wife?\" the crowd on the sidewalk gasped.\n\n108\n00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,400\n\"We haven't even been married a day,\" he sobbed as he rubbed her head with his.\n\n109\n00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,700\n\"I still have to give you your wedding present.\"\n\n110\n00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,820\nThen Romeow licked Drooliet. He licked her face. He licked her ears. He licked her paws.\n\n111\n00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,280\nSlowly, Drooliet opened her eyes.\n\n112\n00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,960\nShe whimpered, \"Oh, Romeow, it's you!\"\n\n113\n00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,340\n\"Were you expecting a cat in a hat?\"  Romeow teased.\n\n114\n00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,060\nThe crowd cheered.  The Barkers hugged the Felinis.  The Felinis hugged the Barkers.\n\n115\n00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,640\nTurbo, Benny and Marky even high-fived.\n\n116\n00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,420\nOfficer Prince said it was a miracle and the charges were dropped.\n\n117\n00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,330\nA celebration was planned for that evening.\n\n118\n00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,020\nAnd this time all really WERE welcome.\n\n119\n00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,880\nSo how is it that our heroine lived?\nFrom a gift only her true love could give.\n\n120\n00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,260\nThis cat gave this dog one of his nine lives.\n\n121\n00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,440\nThey shared all the rest at each others' sides.\n\n122\n00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,530\nFelinis and Barkers became fast friends, \nand cats and dogs played together again.\n\n123\n00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,880\nNow stories will come and stories will go.\n\n124\n00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,500\nSome wither and die. Some blossom and grow.\n\n125\n00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,890\nSome live in your heart. So don't you forget the tale of Romeow and Drooliet.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:09,059\nHi, I'm Jane Kaczmarek. Welcome to the Screen Actors Guild Foundation BookPals.\n\n2\n00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:17,750\nEverybody knows that honey is delicious in tea, but can you imagine pouring it on a book? Well Patricia Polacco can.\n\n3\n00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:24,249\nShe's the author and illustrator of a wonderful book, called \"Thank you, Mr. Falker.\"\n\n4\n00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:31,009\nShe begins with a special introduction, a prologue.\n\n5\n00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:40,370\nThe grandpa held the jar of honey so that all the family could see, then dipped a ladle into it and drizzled honey on the cover of a small book.\n\n6\n00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,730\nThe little girl had just turned five.\n\n7\n00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:50,440\n\"Stand up, little one,\" he cooed. \"I did this for your mother, your uncles, your older brother, and now you!\"\n\n8\n00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,060\nThen he handed the book to her. \"Taste!\"\n\n9\n00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,940\nShe dipped her finger into the honey and put it into her mouth.\n\n10\n00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,100\n\"What is that taste?\" the grandma asked.\n\n11\n00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,330\nThe little girl answered, \"Sweet!\"\n\n12\n00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,320\nThen all of the family said in a single voice,\n\n13\n00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:22,590\n\"Yes, and so is knowledge, but knowledge is like the bee that made that sweet honey, you have to chase it through the pages of a book!\"\n\n14\n00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:32,760\nThe little girl knew that the promise to read was at last hers. Soon she was going to learn to read.\n\n15\n00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:40,340\nTrisha, the littlest girl in the family, grew up loving books. Her schoolteacher mother read to her every night.\n\n16\n00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,380\nHer redheaded brother brought his books home from school and shared them.\n\n17\n00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:52,300\nAnd whenever she visited the family farm, her grandfather and grandmother read to her by the stone fireplace.\n\n18\n00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,560\nWhen she turned five and went to kindergarten, most of all she hoped to read.\n\n19\n00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:11,079\nEach day she saw the kids in the first grade across the hall reading, and before the year was over, some of the kids in her own class began to read. But not Trisha.\n\n20\n00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:20,079\nStill, she loved being at school because she could draw. The other kids would crowd around her and watch her do her magic with the crayons.\n\n21\n00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:24,249\n\"In first grade, you'll learn to read,\" her brother said.\n\n22\n00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:28,280\nIn first grade, Trisha sat in a circle with the other kids.\n\n23\n00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,340\nThey were all holding Our Neighborhood, their first reader, sounding out letters and words.\n\n24\n00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:47,980\nThey said, \"Buh- buh- buh- oy, boy, and luh- luh- ook, look.\" The teacher smiled at them when they put all the sounds together and got a word right.\n\n25\n00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:56,259\nBut when Trisha looked at a page, all she saw were wiggling shapes, and when she tried to sound out words, the other kids laughed at her.\n\n26\n00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:01,319\n\"Trisha, what are you looking at in that book?\" they'd say.\n\n27\n00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,889\n\"I'm reading!\" she'd say back to them.\n\n28\n00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:14,379\nBut her teacher would move on to the next person. Always when it was her turn to read, her teacher had to help her with every single word.\n\n29\n00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:22,699\nAnd while the other kids moved up into the second reader and third reader, she stayed alone in Our Neighborhood.\n\n30\n00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:30,199\nTrisha began to feel \"different.\" She began to feel dumb.\n\n31\n00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:39,760\nThe harder words got for the little girl, the more and more time she spent drawing--\n how she loved to draw! --or just sitting and dreaming.\n\n32\n00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,609\nOr, when she could, going for walks with her grandmother.\n\n33\n00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:49,979\nOne summer day she and her grandma were walking together in the small woods behind their farm. It was twilight.\n\n34\n00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,829\nThe air was sweet and warm. Fireflies were just coming up from the grasses.\n\n35\n00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,160\nAs they walked, Trisha said, \"Gramma, do you think I'm... different?\"\n\n36\n00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:11,060\n\"Of course,\" her grandma answered. \"To be different is the miracle of life. You see all of those little fireflies? Every one is different.\"\n\n37\n00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,519\n\"Do you think I'm smart?\" Trisha didn't feel smart.\n\n38\n00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:26,290\nHer grandma hugged her. \"You are the smartest, quickest, dearest little thing ever.\"\n\n39\n00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:33,640\nRight then the little girl felt safe in her grandma's arms. Reading didn't matter so much.\n\n40\n00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:41,559\nTrisha's grandma used to say that the stars were holes in the sky. They were the light of heaven coming from the other side.\n\n41\n00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:47,060\nAnd she used to say that someday she would be on the other side, where the light comes from.\n\n42\n00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,340\nOne evening they lay on the grass together and counted the lights from heaven.\n\n43\n00:04:51,340 --> 00:05:02,080\n\"You know,\" her grandmother said, \"all of us will go there someday. Hang on to the grass, or you'll lift right off the ground, and there you'll be!\"\n\n44\n00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,009\nThey laughed, and both hung on to the grass.\n\n45\n00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:15,160\nBut it was not long after that night that her grandmother must have let go of the grass, because she went to where the lights were, on the other side.\n\n46\n00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,629\nAnd not long after that, Trisha's grandpa let go of the grass, too.\n\n47\n00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,319\nSchool seemed harder and harder now.\n\n48\n00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,780\nReading was just plain torture. When Sue Ellyn read her page, or Tommy Bob read his page,\n\n49\n00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:37,180\nthey read so easily that Trisha would watch the top of their heads to see if something was happening to their heads that wasn't happening to hers.\n\n50\n00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:43,939\nAnd numbers were the hardest thing of all to read. She never added anything right.\n\n51\n00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:48,639\n\"Line the numbers up before you add them,\" the teacher would say.\n\n52\n00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,300\nBut when Trisha tried, the numbers looked like a stack of blocks, wobbly and ready to fall.\n\n53\n00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,429\nShe just knew she was dumb.\n\n54\n00:05:58,429 --> 00:06:06,880\nThen, one day, her mother announced that she had gotten a teaching job in California! A long way from the family farm in Michigan.\n\n55\n00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,960\nEven though her grandma and grandpa were gone, the little girl didn't want to move.\n\n56\n00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,200\nMaybe, though, the teachers and kids in her new school wouldn't know how dumb she was.\n\n57\n00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:27,639\nShe and her mother and brother moved across the country in a two-toned 1949 Plymouth. It took five days.\n\n58\n00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:44,110\nBut at the new school it was the same. When she tried to read, she stumbled over the words: \"the ca- ca-cat... rrrr, rrr... ran.\" She was reading like a baby in the third grade!\n\n59\n00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:52,480\nAnd when her teacher read along with them, and called on Trisha for an answer, she gave the wrong answer every time.\n\n60\n00:06:52,480 --> 00:07:01,920\n\"Hey, dummy!\" a boy called out to her on the playground, \"How come you're so dumb?\" Other kids stood near him and they laughed.\n\n61\n00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,600\nTrisha could feel the tears burning in her eyes. How she longed to go back to her grandparents' farm in Michigan.\n\n62\n00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:18,889\nNow Trisha wanted to go to school less and less. \"I have a sore throat,\" she'd say to her mother. Or, \"I have a stomachache.\"\n\n63\n00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:27,990\nShe dreamed more and more, and drew more and more, and she hated, hated, hated school.\n\n64\n00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:36,900\nThen, when Trisha started fifth grade, the school was all abuzz. There was a new teacher. He was tall and elegant.\n\n65\n00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:43,340\nEverybody loved his striped coat and slick gray pants-- he wore the neatest clothes.\n\n66\n00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:50,520\nAll the usual teacher's pets gathered around him-- Stevie Joe and Alice Marie, Davy and Michael Lee.\n\n67\n00:07:50,520 --> 00:08:00,860\nBut right from the start, it didn't seem to matter to Mr. Falker which kids were the cutest. Or the smartest. Or the best at anything.\n\n68\n00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:14,740\nMr. Falker would stand behind Trisha whenever she was drawing, and whisper, \"This is brilliant... absolutely brilliant. Do you know how talented you are?\"\n\n69\n00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,480\nWhen he said this, even the kids who teased her would turn around in their seats and look at her drawings.\n\n70\n00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,779\nBut they still laughed whenever she gave a wrong answer.\n\n71\n00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,580\nThen, one day, she had to stand up and read, which she hated.\n\n72\n00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:36,420\nShe was stumbling through a page in Charlotte's Web, and the page was going all fuzzy, when the kids began to laugh out loud.\n\n73\n00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:48,880\nMr. Falker, in his plaid jacket and his butterfly tie, said, \"Stop! Are all of you so perfect that you can look at another person and find fault with her?\"\n\n74\n00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:57,500\nThat was the last day anybody laughed out loud. Or made fun of her. All except Eric.\n\n75\n00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:06,510\nHe had sat behind Trisha for two whole years, but he seemed almost to hate her. Trisha didn't know why.\n\n76\n00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:15,090\nHe waited by the door of the classroom for her and pulled her hair. He waited for her on the playground, leaned in her face, and called her, \"Toad!\"\n\n77\n00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:21,480\nTrisha was afraid to turn any corner, for fear Eric would be there. She felt completely alone.\n\n78\n00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:30,070\nThe only time she was really happy was when she was around Mr. Falker. He let her erase the blackboards-- only the best students got to do that.\n\n79\n00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:38,250\nHe patted her on the back whenever she got something right, and he looked hard and mean at any kid who teased her.\n\n80\n00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,750\nBut the nicer Mr. Falker was to Trisha, the worse Eric treated her.\n\n81\n00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:55,450\nHe got all the other kids to wait for her on the playground, or in the cafeteria, or even in the bathroom, and to jump out and call her \"Stupid\" or \"Ugly!\"\n\n82\n00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,710\nAnd Trisha began to believe them.\n\n83\n00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:09,010\nShe discovered that if she asked to go to the bathroom just before recess, she could hide under the inside stairwell during the free time, and not have to go outside at all.\n\n84\n00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,410\nIn that dark place she felt completely safe.\n\n85\n00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:21,670\nBut one day at recess, Eric followed her to her secret hiding place. \"Have you become a mole?\" he laughed.\n\n86\n00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:27,390\nAnd he pulled her out into the hall, and danced around her. \"Dumbell, dumbell, magotty old dumbell!\n\n87\n00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:34,810\nTrisha buried her head in her arms and curled up in a ball. Suddenly, she heard footsteps. It was Mr. Falker.\n\n88\n00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:46,860\nHe marched Eric down to the office. When he came back, he found Trisha. \"I don't think you'll have to worry about that boy again,\" he said softly.\n\n89\n00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,340\n\"What was he teasing you about, little one?\"\n\n90\n00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,950\n\"I don't know.\" Trisha shrugged.\n\n91\n00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:02,740\nTrisha was sure Mr. Falker believed that she could read. She had learned to memorize what the kid next to her was reading.\n\n92\n00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:11,680\nOr she would wait for Mr. Falker to help her with a sentence, then she'd say the same thing that he did. \"Good,\" he would say.\n\n93\n00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:23,850\nThen, one day Mr. Falker asked her to stay after school and help wash the blackboards. He put on music and brought out little sandwiches as they worked and talked.\n\n94\n00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:33,720\nAll at once he said, \"Let's play a game! I'll shout out letters. You write them on the board with the wet sponge as quickly as you can.\"\n\n95\n00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,480\n\"A,\" he shouted. She wiped a watery A.\n\n96\n00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,360\n\"Eight,\" he shouted. She made a watery 8.\n\n97\n00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:51,290\n\"Fourteen... Three... D... M... Q,\" he shouted out. \nHe shouted out many, many letters and numbers.\n\n98\n00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,560\nThen he walked up behind her, and together they looked at the board.\n\n99\n00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:03,280\nIt was a watery mess. Trisha knew that none of the letters or numbers looked like they should.\n\n100\n00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,460\nShe threw the sponge down and tried to run.\n\n101\n00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,260\nBut Mr. Falker caught her arm and sank to his knees in front of her.\n\n102\n00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:21,000\n\"You poor baby,\" he said. \"You think you're dumb, don't you? How awful for you to be so lonely and afraid.\"\n\n103\n00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,480\nShe sobbed.\n\n104\n00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,060\n\"But, little one, don't you understand, you don't see letters or numbers the way other people do.\n\n105\n00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:36,380\nAnd you've gotten through school all this time, and fooled many, many good teachers!\" He smiled at her.\n\n106\n00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:44,030\n\"That took cunning, and smartness, and such, such bravery.\"\n\n107\n00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:54,590\nThen he stood up and finished washing the board. \"We're going to change all that, girl. You're going to read-- I promise you that.\"\n\n108\n00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:01,800\nNow, almost every day after school, she met with Mr. Falker and Miss Plessy, a reading teacher.\n\n109\n00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,760\nThey did a lot of things she didn't even understand!\n\n110\n00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:13,750\nAt first she made circles in sand, and then big sponge letters on the blackboard, going from left to right, left to right.\n\n111\n00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,970\nAnother day they flicked letters on a screen, and Trisha shouted them out loud.\n\n112\n00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:32,420\nStill other days she worked with wooden blocks and built words. Letters, letters, letters. Words, words, words. Always sounding them out. And that felt good.\n\n113\n00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:41,190\nBut though she'd read words, she hadn't read a whole sentence. And deep down she still felt dumb.\n\n114\n00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:52,900\nAnd then one spring day-- had it been three months or four months since they had started?-- Mr. Falker put a book in front of her.\n\n115\n00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:59,980\nShe'd never seen it before. He picked a paragraph in the middle of a page and pointed at it.\n\n116\n00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:11,160\nAlmost as if it were magic, or as if light poured into her brain, the words and sentences started to take shape on the page as they never had before.\n\n117\n00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:22,780\n\"She... marched... them... off... to...\" \nSlowly, she read a sentence. Then another, and another.\n\n118\n00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:29,140\nAnd finally she'd read a paragraph. And she understood the whole thing.\n\n119\n00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,620\nShe didn't notice that Mr. Falker and Miss Plessy had tears in their eyes.\n\n120\n00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,380\nThat night, Trisha ran home without stopping to catch her breath.\n\n121\n00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,180\nShe bounded up the front steps, threw open her front door, and ran through the dining room to the kitchen.\n\n122\n00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,880\nShe climbed up on the cupboard and grabbed a jar of honey.\n\n123\n00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:57,760\nThen she went into the living room and found the book on a shelf, the very book that her grandpa had shown her so many years ago.\n\n124\n00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,110\nShe spooned honey on the cover and tasted the sweetness, and said to herself,\n\n125\n00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:17,240\n\"The honey is sweet, and so is knowledge, but knowledge is like the bee who made the honey, it has to be chased through the pages of a book!\"\n\n126\n00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:33,890\nThen she held the book, honey and all, close to her chest. She could feel tears roll down her cheeks, but they weren't tears of sadness-- she was happy, so very happy.\n\n127\n00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:42,520\nNow that's the end of the story, but it's not the end of the book. The author has a little surprise for us. Listen...\n\n128\n00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,780\nThe rest of the year became an odyssey of discovery and adventure for the little girl. She learned to love school.\n\n129\n00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:56,170\nI know because that little girl was me, Patricia Polacco.\n\n130\n00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:03,100\nI saw Mr. Falker again some thirty years later at a wedding. I walked up to him and introduced myself.\n\n131\n00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:11,960\nAt first he had difficulty placing me. Then I told him who I was, and how he had changed my life so many years ago.\n\n132\n00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:30,220\nHe hugged me and asked me what I did for a living. \"Why, Mr. Falker,\" I answered. \"I make books for children. Thank you, Mr. Falker. Thank you.\"\n\n133\n00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,950\nAnd thank you for listening.",
