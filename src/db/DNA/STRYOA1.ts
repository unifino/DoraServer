Welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:20,580\nMy name is Ernest Borgnine and we're going to be reading a book today called \"The Rainbow Fish\" by Marcus Pfister.\n\n3\n00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,500\nAll right. Here we go.\n\n4\n00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,640\nA long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish.\n\n5\n00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:40,920\nNot just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean.\n\n6\n00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:50,760\nHis scales were every shade of blue and green and purple, with sparkling silver scales among them.\n\n7\n00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,100\nOh, beautiful.\n\n8\n00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,780\nThe other fish were amazed at his beauty. They called him Rainbow Fish.\n\n9\n00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,550\n\"Come on, Rainbow Fish,\" they would call.\n\n10\n00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,690\n\"Come and play with us!\"\n\n11\n00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:15,940\nBut the Rainbow Fish would just glide past, proud and silent, letting his scales shimmer.\n\n12\n00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:25,620\nOne day, a little blue fish followed after him. \"Rainbow Fish,\" he called,\n\n13\n00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:35,440\n\"Wait for me! Please give me one of your shiny scales. They are so wonderful and you have so many.\"\n\n14\n00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:42,790\n\"You want me to give you one of my special scales? Who do you think you are?\" cried the Rainbow Fish.\n\n15\n00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,520\n\"Get away from me!\"\n\n16\n00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,950\nShocked, the little blue fish swam away.\n\n17\n00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,050\nHe was so upset, he told all his friends of what had happened.\n\n18\n00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:59,049\nFrom then on, no one would have anything to do with the Rainbow Fish.\n\n19\n00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,000\nThey turned away when he swam by.\n\n20\n00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,420\nWhat good were the dazzling, shimmering scales with no one to admire them?\n\n21\n00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:20,259\nNow he was the loneliest fish in the entire ocean.\n\n22\n00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:25,309\nOne day, he poured out his troubles to the starfish.\n\n23\n00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:30,339\n\"I really am beautiful, why doesn't anybody like me?\"\n\n24\n00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,500\n\"I can't answer that for you,\" said the starfish. \"But if you go beyond the coral reef\n\n25\n00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:45,580\nto a deep cave, you will find the wise octopus. Maybe she can help you.\"\n\n26\n00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:52,840\nThe Rainbow Fish found the cave. It was very dark inside and he couldn't see anything.\n\n27\n00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:01,789\nAnd then suddenly two eyes caught him in their glare and the octopus emerged from the darkness.\n\n28\n00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:07,340\n\"I have been waiting for you,\" said the octopus with a deep voice.\n\n29\n00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,320\n\"The waves have told me your story. This is my advice.\n\n30\n00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:24,280\nGive a glittering scale to each of the other fish. You will no longer be the most beautiful fish in the sea,\n\n31\n00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,580\nbut you will discover how to be happy.\n\n32\n00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:37,520\n\"I, I can't... \" the Rainbow Fish started to say, but the octopus had already disappeared into a dark cloud of ink.\n\n33\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,840\nGive away my scales? My beautiful, shining scales? Never.\n\n34\n00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,080\nHow could I ever be happy without them?\n\n35\n00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:57,689\nSuddenly, he felt the light touch of a fin. The little blue fish was back!\n\n36\n00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:04,939\n\"Rainbow Fish, please, don't be angry. I just want one little scale.\"\n\n37\n00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:16,500\nThe Rainbow Fish wavered. Only one very very small shimmery scale, he thought.\n\n38\n00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,200\nWell, maybe I wouldn't miss just one.\n\n39\n00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,220\nCarefully, the Rainbow Fish pulled out the smallest scale and gave it to the little fish.\n\n40\n00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,840\n\"Oh, thank you! Thank you very much!\" the little blue fish bubbled playfully\n\n41\n00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,220\nas he tucked the shiny scale among his blue ones.\n\n42\n00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,300\nA rather peculiar feeling came over the Rainbow Fish.\n\n43\n00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:54,300\nFor a long time, he watched the little blue fish swim back and forth with his new scale glittering in the water.\n\n44\n00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,440\nThe little blue fish whizzed through the ocean with his scale flashing,\n\n45\n00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:04,389\nso it didn't take long before the Rainbow Fish was surrounded by the other fish.\n\n46\n00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,079\nEveryone wanted a glittering scale.\n\n47\n00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:17,569\nThe Rainbow Fish shared his scales left and right. And the more he gave away, the more delighted he became.\n\n48\n00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:27,580\nWhen the water around him filled with glimmering scales, he at last felt at home among the other fish.\n\n49\n00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,960\nFinally the Rainbow Fish had only one shining scale left.\n\n50\n00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:43,240\nHis most prized possessions had been given away, and yet he was very happy.\n\n51\n00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,180\n\"Come on, Rainbow Fish,\" they called, \"Come and play with us!\"\n\n52\n00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,300\n\"Here I come!\" said the Rainbow Fish\n\n53\n00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,020\nand, happy as a splash, he swam off to join his friends.\n\n54\n00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:14,580\nThat wonderful? That's called \"The Rainbow Fish,\" by Marcus Pfister, okay.",

No one ate lunch with Clark.\n\n22\n00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,300\nNo one sat with him at circle time. Even his best friend, Joey Mackerel, said,\n\n23\n00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,760\n“Cool your jets, Clark! You’re making me crazy!”\n\n24\n00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,960\nOne day, Clark asked Mrs. Inkydink, “What’s wrong with everyone?”\n\n25\n00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,360\nMrs. Inkydink patted his fin.\n\n26\n00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:13,080\n“Clark, sometimes you play too hard, you munch too hard, and —gosh— you even help too hard.”\n\n27\n00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,360\n“But life is SO exciting!” said Clark.\n\n28\n00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,240\n“There’s a time and a place for everything,” said Mrs. Inkydink.\n\n29\n00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,580\n“And sometimes the rule is stay cool.”\n\n30\n00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,360\nAt recess, Clark tried to stay cool, but he pushed the swing with too much zing!\n\n31\n00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,380\n“Sorry,” said Clark. “I forgot.”\n\n32\n00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,540\n“Yikes!” cried Joey Mackerel.\n\n33\n00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:47,880\nAt lunch, Clark tried to stay cool, but everything smelled so good that he munched a bunch of lunches.\n\n34\n00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,700\n“Sorry,” said Clark. “I forgot.”\n“We’re STARVING!” said his friends.\n\n35\n00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,000\nIn class, Clark tried to stay cool, but a good book got him all shook up.\n\n36\n00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,880\n“Now, Clark!” said Mrs. Inkydink. “This isn’t the time or the place.

He listened to Mr. Hosking who told him scary stories.\n\n10\n00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,520\nHe played with Mr. Tippet who was crazy about cricket. He ran errands for Ms. Mitchell who walked with a wooden stick.\n\n11\n00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,740\nHe admired Mr. Drysdale who had a voice like a giant,\n\n12\n00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:20,030\nbut his favorite person of all was Ms. Nancy Alison Delacourt Cooper because she had 4 names, just as he did.\n\n13\n00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,880\nHe called her Ms. Nancy and told her all his secrets.\n\n14\n00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,080\nOne day Wilfrid Gordon heard his mother and father talking about Ms. Nancy.\n\n15\n00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,740\n\"Poor old thing,\" said his mother.\n\"Why is she a poor old thing?\" asked Wilfrid Gordon.\n\n16\n00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,570\n\"Because she's lost her memory,\" said his father.\n\"It isn't surprising,\" said his mother. \"After all, she is 96.\"\n\n17\n00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,820\n\"What's a memory?\" asked Wilfrid Gordon.

Big Anthony did his work\n\n29\n00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,160\nand Strega Nona met with the people who came to see her\n\n30\n00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,100\nfor headaches and husbands and warts.\n\n31\n00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,860\nBig Anthony had a nice bed to sleep in next to the goat shed,\n\n32\n00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,780\nand he had food to eat.\n\n33\n00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,940\nOne evening when Big Anthony was milking the goat,\n\n34\n00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,330\nhe heard Strega Nona singing.\n\n35\n00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,180\nPeeking in the window,\n\n36\n00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,220\nhe saw Strega Nona standing over the pasta pot.\n\n37\n00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,560\nShe sang,\n\n38\n00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,380\nBubble, bubble, pasta pot,\n\n39\n00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,300\nBoil me some pasta, nice and hot,\n\n40\n00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,220\nI'm hungry and it's time to sup,\n\n41\n00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,460\nBoil me some pasta to fill me up.\n\n42\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,340\nAnd the pasta pot bubbled and boiled and was soon filled\n\n43\n00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,120\nwith steaming hot pasta.\n\n44\n00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,220\nThen Strega Nona sang,\n\n45\n00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,360\nEnough, enough, pasta pot,\n\n46\n00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,920\nI have my pasta, nice and hot\n\n47\n00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,980\nSo simmer down my pot of clay,\n\n48\n00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,020\n'Til I'm hungry another day.\n\n49\n00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,640\n\"How wonderful!\" said Big Anthony.\n\n50\n00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,900\n\"That's a magic pot for sure!\"\n\n51\n00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,180\nAnd Strega Nona called Big Anthony in for supper.\n\n52\n00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,320\nBut too bad for Big Anthony, because he didn't get to\n\n53\n00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,760\nsee Strega Nona blow three kisses\n\n54\n00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400\nto the magic pot.\n\n55\n00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,660\nAnd this is what happened.\n\n56\n00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,640\nThe next day when Big Anthony went to the town square\n\n57\n00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,820\nto fetch the water,\n\n58\n00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,440\nhe told everyone about the pasta pot.\n\n59\n00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,140\nAnd naturally everyone laughed at him,\n\n60\n00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,720\nbecause it sounded so silly —\n\n61\n00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,599\na pot that cooked all by itself.\n\n62\n00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,180\n\"You'd better go and confess to the priest,\n\n63\n00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,559\nBig Anthony,\" they said. \"Such a lie!\"\n\n64\n00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,580\nAnd Big Anthony was angry\n\n65\n00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,380\nand that wasn't a very good thing to be.\n\n66\n00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,420\n\"I'll show them!\" He said to himself.\n\n67\n00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,200\n\"Someday I will get the pasta pot and make it cook!\n\n68\n00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,580\nAnd then they'll be sorry.\"\n\n69\n00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,580\nThat day came sooner than even Big Anthony could have thought,\n\n70\n00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,200\nbecause two days later Strega Nona said to Big Anthony,\n\n71\n00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,080\n\"Anthony, I must go over the mountain to the next town\n\n72\n00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,260\nto see my friend, Strega Amelia.\n\n73\n00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,340\nSweep the house and weed the garden.\n\n74\n00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,240\nFeed the goat and milk her, and for your lunch,\n\n75\n00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,520\nthere's some bread and cheese in the cupboard.\n\n76\n00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,320\nAnd remember, don't touch the pasta pot.\"\n\n77\n00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,900\n\"Oh, yes—yes—Strega Nona,\" said Big Anthony.\n\n78\n00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,380\nBut inside he was thinking, my chance has come!\n\n79\n00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,060\nAs soon as Strega Nona was out of sight,\n\n80\n00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,700\nBig Anthony went inside,\n\n81\n00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,300\npulled the pasta pot off the shelf, and put it on the floor.\n\n82\n00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,220\n\"Now, let's see if I can remember the words,\" said Big Anthony.\n\n83\n00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,460\nAnd Big Anthony sang,\n\n84\n00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,860\nand you feel free to sing along with me if you remember the words.\n\n85\n00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,800\nBubble, bubble, pasta pot,\n\n86\n00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,600\nBoil me some pasta, nice and hot,\n\n87\n00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,500\nI'm hungry and it's time to sup,\n\n88\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,300\nBoil enough to fill me up.\n\n89\n00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,100\nAnd sure enough, the pot bubbled and boiled\n\n90\n00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,560\nand began to fill up with pasta.\n\n91\n00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,520\n\"Aha!\" said Big Anthony, and he ran to the town square,\n\n92\n00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,720\njumped on the fountain, and shouted,\n\n93\n00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,940\n\"Everybody get forks and plates and platters and bowls.\n\n94\n00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,600\nPasta for all at Strega Nona's house.\n\n95\n00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,440\nBig Anthony has made the magic pasta pot work.\"\n\n96\n00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,660\nOf course everyone laughed, but ran home\n\n97\n00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,340\nto get forks and plates and platters and bowls,\n\n98\n00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,640\nand sure enough, when they got to Strega Nona's\n\n99\n00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,620\nthe pasta pot was so full it was beginning to overflow.\n\n100\n00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,780\nBig Anthony was a hero!\n\n101\n00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,100\nHe scooped out pasta and filled the plates and platters and bowls.\n\n102\n00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,460\nThere was more than enough for all the townspeople,\n\n103\n00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,300\nincluding the priests and the sisters from the convent.\n\n104\n00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,260\nAnd some people came back for two and three helpings,\n\n105\n00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,580\nbut the pot was never empty.\n\n106\n00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,720\nWhen all had had their fill, Big Anthony sang,\n\n107\n00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,480\nEnough, enough, pasta pot,\n\n108\n00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,220\nI have my pasta nice and hot.\n\n109\n00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,280\nSo simmer down, my pot of clay\n\n110\n00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,140\nUntil I’m hungry another day\n\n111\n00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,760\nBut, alas, he did not blow the three kisses!\n\n112\n00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,800\nHe went outside and to the applause of the crowd,\n\n113\n00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,180\nBig Anthony took a bow.\n\n114\n00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,760\nHe was so busy listening to compliments from everyone\n\n115\n00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,500\nthat he didn’t notice\nthe pasta pot was still bubbling and boiling,\n\n116\n00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,150\nuntil a sister from the convent said,\n\n117\n00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,620\n“Oh, Big Anthony, look!”\n\n118\n00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,560\nAnd pasta was pouring out of the pot all over the floor\n\n119\n00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,280\nof Strega Nona’s house\nand was coming out the door!\n\n120\n00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,540\nBig Anthony rushed in and shouted the magic words again,\n\n121\n00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,260\nbut the pot kept bubbling.\n\n122\n00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,460\nHe took the pot off the floor, but pasta kept pouring from it.\n\n123\n00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,020\nBig Anthony grabbed a cover and put it on the pot and sat on it.\n\n124\n00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,340\nBut the pasta raised the cover, and Big Anthony as well,\n\n125\n00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,120\nand spilled on the floor of Strega Nona’s house.\n\n126\n00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,520\n“Stop!” yelled Big Anthony.\n\n127\n00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,040\nBut the pasta did not stop\n\n128\n00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,160\nand if someone hadn’t grabbed poor Big Anthony,\n\n129\n00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,140\nthe pasta would have covered him up.\n\n130\n00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,920\nThe pasta had all but filled the little house.\n\n131\n00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,940\nOut of the windows and through the doors came the pasta\n\n132\n00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,840\nand the pot kept right on bubbling.\n\n133\n00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,000\nThe townspeople began to worry.\n\n134\n00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,480\n“Do something, Big Anthony,” they shouted.\n\n135\n00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,020\nBig Anthony sang the magic song again\n\n136\n00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,220\nbut without the three kisses it did\nno good!\n\n137\n00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,900\nBy this time the pasta was on its way down the road\n\n138\n00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,260\nand all the people were\nrunning to keep ahead of it.\n\n139\n00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,660\n“We must protect our town from the pasta,” shouted the mayor.\n\n140\n00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,720\n“Get mattresses, tables, doors —\nanything to make a barricade.”\n\n141\n00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,120\nBut even that didn’t work.\n\n142\n00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,380\nThe pot kept bubbling and the pasta kept coming!\n\n143\n00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,300\n“We are lost,” said the people,\n\n144\n00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,000\nand the priest and the sisters of the convent began praying.\n\n145\n00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,500\n“The pasta will cover our town,” they cried.\n\n146\n00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,580\nAnd it certainly would have,\n\n147\n00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,120\nhad Strega Nona not come down the road,\nhome from her visit.\n\n148\n00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,680\nShe didn’t have to look twice to know what had happened.\n\n149\n00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,480\nShe sang the magic song and blew the three kisses\n\n150\n00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,900\nand with a sputter the pot stopped boiling\n\n151\n00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,720\nand the pasta came to a halt.\n\n152\n00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,180\n“Oh, grazie—thank you, thank you, Strega Nona,” the people cried.\n\n153\n00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,340\nBut then they turned on poor Big Anthony.\n\n154\n00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,980\n“String him up,” the men of the town shouted.\n\n155\n00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,920\n“Now, wait,” said Strega Nona.\n\n156\n00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,160\n“The punishment must fit the crime.”\n\n157\n00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,020\nAnd she took a fork from a lady standing nearby\n\n158\n00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,220\nand held it out to Big Anthony.\n\n159\n00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,960\n“All right, Anthony,\n\n160\n00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,600\nyou wanted pasta from my magic pasta pot,” \nStrega Nona said,\n\n161\n00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,360\n“and I want to sleep in my little bed tonight.\n\n162\n00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,960\nSo start eating.”\n\n163\n00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320\nAnd he did —\n\n164\n00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,040\npoor Big Anthony.\n\n165\n00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,660\nThe end.\n\n166\n00:10:38,440 -->

He liked to do the same thing every day.\n\n5\n00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,380\nEvery morning he woke up at the same time. Every morning he stretched.\n\n6\n00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,080\nHe scratched. He yawned a\ngreat yawn.\n\n7\n00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,640\nEvery morning the bees delivered three\njars full of honey.\n\n8\n00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,820\nBenedict ate the same breakfast he'd\neaten since he was just a fuzzy cub:\ntoast with honey and tea with extra\nhoney.\n\n9\n00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:53,020\nNext came his daily routine: practicing, perfecting his honey cake recipe, \nknitting, and running errands.\n\n10\n00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,000\nAt night he'd read then have one last\ncup of honey tea before bed. Life was sweet.\n\n11\n00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,900\nUntil one morning... one morning\nthings weren't the same.\n\n12\n00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,360\nIn fact, something terribly un-same had happened.\n\n13\n00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,140\nThere was no more honey. The bees had\ngone on strike!\n\n14\n00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,680\nBenedict's breakfast wasn't the same\nwithout honey.\nWithout his honey tea, he couldn't knit.\n\n15\n00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,200\nPractice was dreadful. He didn't even bother with the errands.\n\n16\n00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:36,920\nBenedict became deeply discouraged. Just then he heard someone say, \"Hey, you! In the fur coat!\"\n\n17\n00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,100\nIt was a very small bee with a remarkably loud voice. \"We need to talk!\" said the bee.\n\n18\n00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:50,100\n\"Talk? Hmmph!\" grumbled Benedict. \"I let you all live in my yard. All I ask is for a few jars of honey.\"\n\n19\n00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,060\n\"You should be grateful. Not go on strike!\"\n\n20\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,040\n\"A few jars?\" said the bee. \"Buddy, we deliver three jars of honey to you every day.\"\n\n21\n00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,180\n\"Every month! Every year! Do the math, Einstein!”\n\n22\n00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,300\n“The hive is a wreck!” the bee continued.  “It’s all we can do to keep the walls from falling in!\"\n\n23\n00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,240\n\"The roof leaks. Wind blows through the cracks.\"\n\n24\n00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,600\n\"The last three queens up and quit on us because of the lousy work conditions.\"\n\n25\n00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,540\nThe bee showed Benedict the garden. \"Look!\" the bee said. \"Weeds everywhere.\"\n\n26\n00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,920\n\"We have to fly miles away just to find enough flowers to make our honey. So we voted to strike.”\n\n27\n00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,600\n\"You’re taking us for granted,” the bee declared. “You want honey? Things need to change. It’s up to you, bear.”\n\n28\n00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,120\nAnd with that, the very small bee flew off.\n\n29\n00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,280\nThe thought of losing his honey sent a chill down Benedict’s spine. He had a lot to think about.\n\n30\n00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:54,320\n“Maybe I’ve been too selfish,” Benedict said to himself. “I never thought about what the bees need. \nBut how am I going to make this right?\"\n\n31\n00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:02,460\nSo he did some research. He did a little shopping.\nAnd he did a lot of work.\n\n32\n00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,200\nBenedict even learned how to harvest honey.\n\n33\n00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,520\n“I suppose it’s a bit rude to expect them to do it all themselves,” he thought.\n\n34\n00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,260\nFinally, he was ready to show the bees all the work he’d done. What would they think?\n\n35\n00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,920\nHe held his breath as he waited. Then he heard the remarkably loud voice of the very small bee…\n\n36\n00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,320\n“DROP THE SIGNS, GIRLS! TIME TO GET BACK TO WORK!”\n\n37\n00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,180\nThese days, Benedict is still a creature of habit.\nHe still has his daily routine,\n\n38\n00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,080\nbut he doesn’t take the honey for granted anymore.\nHe knows his life is sweet...\n\n39\n00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,100\nbut now it's even sweeter...\n\n40\n00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,000\nfor everyone.\n\n41\n00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,300\nThe end.\n\n42\n00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,880\nI really enjoyed this book because it's all about being able to live with each other, and respect each other,\n\n43\n00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,040\nand give and take. Because that's the best part about being in a community,\n\n44\n00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,300\nis being able to live together and have everybody's life be sweet at the same time.\n\n45\n00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,680\nThank you for watching Storyline Online. \nMake sure to watch all our other stories.\n\n46\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,180\nKeep watching and keep reading!",
