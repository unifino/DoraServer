		"text"		: "1\n00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,240\nHi, Welcome to SAG Foundation's BookPALS Storyline Online.\n\n2\n00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:18,099\nMy name is Eric Close, and today, I'm going to be reading \"When Pigasso met Mootisse,\" written and illustrated by Nina Laden.\n\n3\n00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,520\nThere once was a young pig named Pigasso.\n\n4\n00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,520\nWhile the other piglets rolled in the mud and played games, Pigasso painted.\n\n5\n00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,570\nHe painted anything and everything, and in a most unusual way.\n\n6\n00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,200\nAt the same time, there was a young bull named Mootisse.\n\n7\n00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,460\nMootisse was not like the other bulls. He wasn't interested in bull fighting.\n\n8\n00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:53,740\nMootisse was happy only when he painted pictures. And he painted big, bold, bright pictures.\n\n9\n00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,320\nIn time, word of Pigasso's talent spread throughout the pig provinces.\n\n10\n00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,000\nSoon, art loving pigs from all over lined up to buy his creations.\n\n11\n00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,080\nAt the same time, Mootisse was getting famous in the cattle community.\n\n12\n00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,580\nThere weren't many households that didn't own a \"Moosterpiece.\"\n\n13\n00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:20,259\nPigasso and Mootisse were becoming art superstars.  But this came with a price.\n\n14\n00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:27,080\nEverybody wanted to see them: art buyers, art sellers, art students, art historians, art groupies.\n\n15\n00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,220\nIt was an art attack!\n\n16\n00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,120\nOne day Pigasso got fed up and said, \"I'm tired of this noisy pig pen.\"\n\n17\n00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,400\nAt the same time Mootisse declared, \"I'm sick of this crowded cow town.\"\n\n18\n00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,900\nNeeding a change, they both decided to look for a peaceful place where they could paint without distractions.\n\n19\n00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,280\nSo each of the two artists looked far and wide for the perfect spot.\n\n20\n00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,000\nPigasso found a lovely farm looking towards the east.\n\n21\n00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,200\nMootisse found a handsome farm facing the west.\n\n22\n00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,740\nAfter Pigasso moved in, he went to introduce himself to his new neighbor across the road.\n\n23\n00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,640\nAt the same time, Mootisse went to introduce himself to his new neighbor across the road.\n\n24\n00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,919\nThat is how Pigasso met Mootisse.\n\n25\n00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:21,109\nAnd coincidentally, that is how Mootisse met Pigasso.\n\n26\n00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:26,200\nAt first, Pigasso and Mootisse were friendly and welcomed each other as neighbors.\n\n27\n00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,320\nBut soon, things began to change.\n\n28\n00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,660\nIt started one day when Pigasso criticized one of Mootisse's paintings.\n\n29\n00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,680\nThen Mootisse made fun of one of Pigasso's.\n\n30\n00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:46,049\nMootisse called Pigasso an \"Art Hog.\"  \nThen Pigasso called Mootisse a \"Mad Cow.\"\n\n31\n00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:53,759\nMootisse quipped, \"You paint like a two year old.\"\nPigasso retorted, \"You paint like a wild beast.\"\n\n32\n00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,240\nMootisse raged, \"Your colors look like mud.\" \nPigasso spat, \"Your paintings look like color-by-numbers!\"\n\n33\n00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,720\nThen things got really out of hand.\n\n34\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,820\nIt was a modern art mess.\n\n35\n00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:20,980\nPigasso stormed off into his house. \"That Mootisse doesn't like my art,\" he huffed. \"Well, I'll show him.\"\n\n36\n00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,600\nAnd Mootisse bullied his way into his house, \"I'll give that Pigasso something he can really criticize,\" he snorted.\n\n37\n00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,140\nThen a full-scale feud erupted. But it was a most unusual battle.\n\n38\n00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,880\nArmed with ladders and buckets of paint, Mootisse launched the first attack.\n\n39\n00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:51,440\nHe started at dawn. By the end of the evening he had succeeded in transforming the outside of his house into a monster-sized \"Moosterpiece.\"\n\n40\n00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,180\nNot to be outdone, Pigasso fired up his paint brushes and, in full view of the enemy, counter-attacked.\n\n41\n00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,860\nHe turned his farm into a huge and outrageous \"Pork of Art.\"\n\n42\n00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,140\nThe two artists then retreated into their houses and pulled down the shades.\n\n43\n00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,880\nPigasso certainly didn't want to look out his window and stare at a \"Mootisse.\"\n\n44\n00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,780\nAnd Mootisse had no desire to give his rooms a view of a \"Pigasso.\"\n\n45\n00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:28,160\nThis presented a problem. And there seemed to be only one solution.\n\n46\n00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:36,860\nWithout a word to each other, Pigasso and Mootisse each began to build a huge wooden fence down the middle of their road.\n\n47\n00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:44,960\nAt first, Pigasso and Mootisse seemed satisfied. Both artists went back to painting by themselves.\n\n48\n00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,639\nBut after awhile, Pigasso was surprised to find that he missed that bull-headed Mootisse.\n\n49\n00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,400\nAt the same time, Mootisse found his studio empty without the presence of pig-headed Pigasso.\n\n50\n00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:08,180\nPigasso pondered, \"That Mootisse isn't such a bad artist. He has some interesting ideas.\"\n\n51\n00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:17,420\nMootisse moaned, \"That Pigasso may not paint like me, but he knows what he's doing.\"\n\n52\n00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:26,280\nHowever, being naturally pig-headed and bull-headed, neither artist knew how to apologize to the other.\n\n53\n00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,360\nSo they did what they do best. They let their paint brushes do the talking.\n\n54\n00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,700\nPigasso painted on one side of the fence, and Mootisse painted on the other.\n\n55\n00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,200\nEach worked until they were exhausted.\n\n56\n00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,080\nIt was strangely quiet when they were done.\n\n57\n00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:52,860\nThen, curious to see what Mootisse had been doing, Pigasso sprinted around to the other side.\n\n58\n00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,300\nAt the same time, Mootisse galloped over to Pigasso's side.\n\n59\n00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,220\nThe silence was broken as the two artists began laughing at their amazing work of heart.\n\n60\n00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,380\nFrom that day on, Pigasso and Mootisse became great friends.\n\n61\n00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,110\nThey happily took down the fence and shared their different views.\n\n62\n00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,439\nA few months later, a big museum bought the fence.\n\n63\n00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:28,819\nPigasso called his side: \"When Pigasso Met Mootisse.\"  Mootisse called his side: \"When Mootisse Met Pigasso.\"\n\n64\n00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,280\nThe critics called it \"Incredible.\"\n\n65\n00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:43,740\nNow, Picasso and Matisse weren't actually a pig and a bull, they were really two of the greatest artists of the twentieth century.\n\n66\n00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:48,660\nWhen you get the chance, I really encourage you to go and check out their paintings in a museum.\n\n67\n00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,680\nThey are beautiful and I think you'll love them.

Stellaluna,\" she crooned.\n\n8\n00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,000\nEach night, Mother Bat would carry Stellaluna clutched to her breast...\n\n9\n00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,090\n...as she flew out to search for food.\n\n10\n00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:02,180\nOne night, as Mother Bat followed the heavy scent of ripe fruit, an owl spied her.\n\n11\n00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,400\nOn silent wings, the powerful bird swooped down upon the bats.\n\n12\n00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,170\nDodging and shrieking, Mother Bat tried to escape,\n\n13\n00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,230\nbut the owl struck again and again, knocking Stellaluna into the air.\n\n14\n00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,120\nHer baby wings were as limp and useless as wet paper.\n\n15\n00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:30,900\nDown, down she went, faster and faster; into the forest below.\n\n16\n00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,280\nThe dark leafy tangle of branches caught Stellaluna as she fell.\n\n17\n00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,460\nOne twig was small enough for Stellaluna's tiny feet.\n\n18\n00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:49,560\nWrapping her wings about her, she clutched the thin branch, trembling with cold and fear:\n\n19\n00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,000\n\"Mother;\" Stellaluna squeaked. \"Where are you?\"\n\n20\n00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,800\nBy daybreak, the baby bat could hold on no longer.\n\n21\n00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,160\nDown, down again she dropped.\n\n22\n00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,420\nFlump! Stellaluna landed headfirst in a soft, downy nest,\n\n23\n00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,749\nstartling the three baby birds who lived there.\n\n24\n00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:19,829\nStellaluna quickly clambered from the nest, and hung out of sight below it.\n\n25\n00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,620\nShe listened to the babble of the three birds.\n\n26\n00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,760\n\"What was that?\" cried Flap.\n\n27\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,320\n\"I don't know, but it's hanging by it's feet,\" chirped Flitter.\n\n28\n00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,500\n\"Shhh! Here comes Mama,\" hissed Pip.\n\n29\n00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,139\nMany, many times that day Mama bird flew away,\n\n30\n00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,949\nalways returning with food for her babies.\n\n31\n00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:52,509\nStellaluna was terribly hungry - but not for the crawly things Mama Bird brought.\n\n32\n00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:55,880\nFinally, though, the little bat could bear it no longer.\n\n33\n00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:02,780\nShe climbed into the nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth.\n\n34\n00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,880\nPlop! In dropped a big green grasshopper.\n\n35\n00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,180\nStellaluna learned to be like the birds. She stayed awake all day and slept at night.\n\n36\n00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,940\nShe ate bugs, even though they tasted awful.\n\n37\n00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,200\nHer bat ways were quickly disappearing.\n\n38\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,219\nExcept for one thing: Stellaluna still liked to sleep hanging by her feet.\n\n39\n00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:34,609\nOnce, when Mama was away, the curious baby birds decided to try it, too.\n\n40\n00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:39,720\nWhen Mama Bird came home, she saw eight tiny feet gripping the edge of the nest.\n\n41\n00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,920\n\"Eeek!\" she cried. \"Get back up here this instant!\n\n42\n00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,069\nYou're going to fall and break your necks!\"\n\n43\n00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,290\nThe birds clambered back into the nest, but Mama Bird stopped Stellaluna.\n\n44\n00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,919\n\"You are teaching my children to do bad things.\"\n\n45\n00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,800\n\"I will not let you back into this nest, unless you promise to obey all the rules of this house.\"\n\n46\n00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,900\nStellaluna promised. She ate bugs without making faces.\n\n47\n00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,599\nShe slept in the nest at night. And she didn't hang by her feet.\n\n48\n00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,999\nStellaluna behaved as a good bird should.\n\n49\n00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:24,530\nAll the babies grew quickly. Soon the nest became crowded.\n\n50\n00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,059\nMama Bird told them it was time to learn to fly.\n\n51\n00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,180\nOne by one, Pip, Flitter, Flap, and Stellaluna jumped from the nest.\n\n52\n00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:41,120\nTheir wings worked! \"I'm just like them,\" thought Stellaluna. \"I can fly, too.\"\n\n53\n00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,580\nPip, Flitter, and Flap landed gracefully on a branch.\n\n54\n00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,419\nStellaluna tried to do the same.\n\n55\n00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,080\nHow embarrassing!\n\n56\n00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,940\nI will fly all day, Stellaluna told herself. Then no one will see how clumsy I am.\n\n57\n00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,860\nThe next day, Pip, Flitter, Flap, and Stellaluna went flying far from home.\n\n58\n00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,300\nThey flew for hours, exercising their new wings.\n\n59\n00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:24,720\n\"The sun is setting,\" warned Flitter.\n\"We had better go home, or we will get lost in the dark,\" said Flap.\n\n60\n00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:36,480\nBut Stellaluna had flown far ahead, and was nowhere to be seen. The three anxious birds went home without her.\n\n61\n00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:44,479\nAll alone, Stellaluna flew and flew until her wings ached and she dropped into a tree.\n\n62\n00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,640\n\"I promised not to hang by my feet,\" Stellaluna sighed.\n\n63\n00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,500\nSo she hung by her thumbs, and soon fell asleep.\n\n64\n00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,560\nShe didn't hear the soft sound of wings coming near.\n\n65\n00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,039\n\"Hey!\" a loud voice said. \"Why are you hanging upside down?\"\n\n66\n00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,260\nStellaluna's eyes opened wide. She saw a most peculiar face.\n\n67\n00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,300\n\"I'm not upside down, you are!\" Stellaluna said.\n\n68\n00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,660\n\"Ah, but you're a bat. Bats hang by their feet. \"\n\n69\n00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:31,180\n\"You are hanging by your thumbs, so that makes you upside down!\" the creature said.\n\n70\n00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:38,760\n\"I'm a bat. I am hanging by my feet. That makes me right side up!\"\n\n71\n00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:47,640\nStellaluna was confused. \"Mama Bird told me I was upside down. She said I was wrong...\"\n\n72\n00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,400\n\"Wrong for a bird, maybe... but not for a bat.\"\n\n73\n00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,740\nMore bats gathered around to see the strange young bat who behaved like a bird.\n\n74\n00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,199\nStellaluna told them her story.\n\n75\n00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,580\n\"You ate b-bugs?\" Stuttered one.\n\n76\n00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,969\n\"You slept at night?\" gasped another.\n\n77\n00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:17,080\n\"How very strange,\" they all murmured.\n\n78\n00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:24,400\n\"Wait, wait! Let me look at this child!\" A bat pushed through the crowd.\n\n79\n00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:28,219\n\"An owl attacked you?\" she asked.\n\n80\n00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:38,540\nSniffing Stellaluna's fur, she whispered, \"You are Stellaluna. You are my baby.\"\n\n81\n00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,840\n\"You escaped the owl?\" cried Stellaluna. \"You survived?\"\n\n82\n00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,400\n\"Yes,\" said Mother Bat as she wrapped her wings around Stellaluna.\n\n83\n00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,479\n\"Come with me, and I'll show you where to find the most delicious fruit.\"\n\n84\n00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,779\n\"You'll never have to eat another bug as long as you live.\"\n\n85\n00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:16,989\n\"But it's nighttime,\" Stellaluna squeaked. \"We can't fly in the dark or we will crash into trees.\"\n\n86\n00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:23,940\n\"We're bats,\" said Mother Bat. \"We can see in darkness. Come with us.\"\n\n87\n00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:31,499\nStellaluna was afraid, but she let go of the tree and dropped into the deep blue sky.\n\n88\n00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:37,340\nStellaluna could see. She felt as though rays of light shone from her eyes.\n\n89\n00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,180\nShe was able to see everything in her path.\n\n90\n00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:48,870\nSoon the bats found a mango tree, and Stellaluna ate as much of the fruit as she could hold.\n\n91\n00:08:48,870 --> 00:09:02,490\n\"I'll never eat another bug as long as I live,\" cheered Stellaluna as she stuffed herself full. \"I must tell Pip, Flitter, and Flap!\"\n\n92\n00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:09,300\nThe next day Stellaluna went to visit the birds. \"Come with me and meet my bat family,\" said Stellaluna.\n\n93\n00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,040\n\"Okay, let's go,\" agreed Pip.\n\n94\n00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:20,120\n\"They hang by their feet and they fly at night and they eat the best food in the world,\" Stellaluna explained to the birds on the way.\n\n95\n00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,740\nAs the birds flew among the bats, Flap said, \"I feel upside down here.\"\n\n96\n00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,640\nSo the birds hung by their feet.\n\n97\n00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,050\n\"Wait until dark,\" Stellaluna said excitedly. \"We will fly at night.\"\n\n98\n00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:42,600\nWhen night came, Stellaluna flew away. Pip, Flitter, and Flap leapt from the tree to follow her.\n\n99\n00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,340\n\"I can't see a thing!\" yelled Pip.\n\n100\n00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,800\n\"Neither can I,\" howled Flitter.\n\n101\n00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,740\n\"Aaeee!\" shrieked Flap.\n\n102\n00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,320\n\"They're going to crash,\" gasped Stellaluna. \"I must rescue them!\"\n\n103\n00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:04,280\nStellaluna swooped about, grabbing her friends in the air. She lifted them to a tree, and the birds grasped a branch.\n\n104\n00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,440\nStellaluna hung from the limb above them.\n\n105\n00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,100\n\"We're safe,\" said Stellaluna. Then she sighed.\n\n106\n00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,410\n\"I wish you could see in the dark too.\"\n\n107\n00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,290\n\"We wish you could land on your feet,\" Flitter replied. Pip and Flap nodded.\n\n108\n00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,690\nThey perched in silence for a long time.\n\n109\n00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:31,950\n\"How can we be so different and feel so much alike?\" mused Flitter.\n\n110\n00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:37,990\n\"And how can we feel so different and be so much alike?\" wondered Pip.\n\n111\n00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,810\n\"I think this is quite a mystery.\" Flap chirped.\n\n112\n00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,680\n\"I agree,\" said Stellaluna. \"But we're friends.\"\n\n113\n00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,250\n\"And that's a fact.\"\n\n114\n00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,450\nI really like this book, and I hope you do too.\n\n115\n00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,340\nAnd I hope you enjoy all the things that you have with your friends that are the same...\n\n116\n00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,890\n...and especially all the things that are different.\n\n117\n00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,400\nHappy reading!",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,629\nHello, I'm Elijah Wood. Welcome to the SAG Foundation Storyline.\n\n2\n00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:18,340\nI'll be reading a story today called \"Me and My Cat,\" by Satoshi Kitamura, both illustrated and written by, so let's get into it.\n\n3\n00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,800\nLate one night an old lady in a pointed hat came in through my bedroom window.\n\n4\n00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,940\nShe brandished her broom at me and fired out some words. Then she left without saying goodbye...\n\n5\n00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,510\n\"Nicholas, wake up! You'll be late for school.\"\n\n6\n00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,910\nIt must be mom. It must be morning again.\n\n7\n00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:48,080\nMom dragged me to the bathroom and made me wash and dress. Downstairs she interrupted my breakfast. She was furious.\n\n8\n00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,360\nShe carried me off to catch the school bus. I had gone... but I was still here...\n\n9\n00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,700\n\"How strange,\" I thought to myself, pulling my whiskers.\n\n10\n00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,480\nWHISKERS?!\n\n11\n00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:08,080\nI rushed to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. Leonardo, my cat, was staring back at me.\n\n12\n00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,260\nBut it wasn't him inside.\n\n13\n00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,240\nIt was me, Nicholas! I couldn't believe my eyes.\n\n14\n00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,850\nI had turned into a cat!\n\n15\n00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,620\n\"Don't panic,\" I told myself. I sat in the armchair to consider the situation carefully...\n\n16\n00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,100\nI fell asleep. When I woke up, I felt a little better.\n\n17\n00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,960\nMaybe it wasn't such a bad thing to be a cat. I didn't have to go to school, did I?\n\n18\n00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:39,049\nI hopped onto the table, and from there to the top of the shelves. What fun! I could never do this before.\n\n19\n00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:47,140\nI decided to leap toward the cupboard on the other side of the room. Ready, set...  oops.\n\n20\n00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,740\nMom threw me out of the house.\n\n21\n00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:57,840\nWhile I was rambling in the garden, Gioconda, the next-door-neighbor cat, came up and licked me all over my face. Yuck!\n\n22\n00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,340\n\"Time to go for a walk,\" I thought.\n\n23\n00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:08,780\nThe brick wall was warm under my paws. As I got close to Miss Thomson's garden, a funny thought occurred to me.\n\n24\n00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,620\nMiss Thomson had given me Leonardo when he was a kitten. Leonardo was Heloise's son.\n\n25\n00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,760\nDid that mean Heloise was now my mother?\n\n26\n00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,900\n\"Miaow, Miam (Hello, Mom),\" I called tentatively. She ignored me completely.\n\n27\n00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:31,849\nFarther along, I came across three mean-looking cats.\n\n28\n00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,240\n\"Excuse me. May I go through?\" I said.\n\n29\n00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,760\n\"No, go away! It's our wall,\" replied one.\n\n30\n00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,640\n\"I think the wall belongs to every--\"\nBut before I could finish my sentence they were all over me.\n\n31\n00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,940\nWe punched and kicked and scratched one another until we fell off the wall, entangled.\n\n32\n00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:56,449\n\"Bowwowowowowowowow!\" A dog came running toward us, barking furiously. The cats ran away in all directions.\n\n33\n00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:02,579\nIt was Bernard, Mr. Stone's dog. He's a sweet dog, my favorite in the neighborhood.\n\n34\n00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,180\n\"Thanks, Bernard. You came just in time.\"  \nBut he chased me out of the garden.\n\n35\n00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,120\nOf course! He couldn't recognize me.\n\n36\n00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,080\nSo this was the world that Leonardo lived in. Life was as tough and complicated as it was for humans.\n\n37\n00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,200\nWhen I got home, I went into the house. Then I heard a scratching noise coming from the front door.\n\n38\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,600\nIt was \"me\" back from school, trying to get in through the cat flap.\n\n39\n00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,840\nBut was he me, \"Nicholas\"? Or was he poor little Leonardo inside my body?\n\n40\n00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,920\nOnce indoors, he continued to behave strangely.\n\n41\n00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,440\nHe scratched himself earnestly, and when that was done, he challenged his shoes until they surrendered.\n\n42\n00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,620\nHe licked his sweater clean, then spent a long time sharpening his nails.\n\n43\n00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,100\nHe found the goldfish particularly fascinating.\n\n44\n00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,220\nHe tried to sort the washing, and then the yarn... but at last he gave up.\n\n45\n00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,969\nHe found the radiator and the litter box irresistible.  But he didn't seen to like me at all.\n\n46\n00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:09,980\nAt last, Mom saw something was wrong with her son. She became so worried that she called the doctor and asked him to come at once.\n\n47\n00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,650\n\"Nothing to worry about,\" said Dr. Wire. \"He's just a little overtired. Send him to bed early and he'll be fine in the morning.\"\n\n48\n00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:26,349\nMom was still very upset.  She held him tight in her arms all evening.  I felt sorry for them both.\n\n49\n00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:35,060\nI climbed on Leonardo-in-my-shape and stroked his cheek. He purred. Then Mom stroked me gently. I purred.\n\n50\n00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,409\nLater that night, the old lady in the pointed hat came in through my bedroom window.\n\n51\n00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,780\n\"Sorry, love. I got the wrong address,\" she said.\n\n52\n00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,500\nShe brandished her broom and blurted out some words. Then she left without saying good night.\n\n53\n00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,620\n\"Nicholas, wake up! You'll be late for school,\" I heard Mom shouting.\n\n54\n00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,080\nEverything was back to normal.\n\n55\n00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,340\nAt school Mr. McGough sat on the table.\n\n56\n00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,460\nHe scratched himself, licked his shirt, and fell asleep for the rest of the lesson.\n\n57\n00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,080\nWell that's the end of our story.  It's been very enjoyable to sit here and read to you.\n\n58\n00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:20,949\nIf you'd like to rent this book from a library, then go to your local library and get this book and maybe you can read along with me.\n\n59\n00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,780\nYou can click on me and I'll read you the story and you can read the book with me. It should be quite enjoyable.\n\n60\n00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,120\nThank you very much.",

(She was reading.)\n\n9\n00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,900\nSoon enough, the eggs began to crack.\n\n10\n00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:03,930\nThe first duckling to hatch had blue spots. Mother Duck called him Crayon.\n\n11\n00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,320\nThe second duckling had brown stripes. \"Zebra,\" Mother Duck decided.\n\n12\n00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,680\nThe third duckling was yellow, and Mother Duck named him Moonlight.\n\n13\n00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,730\nA rather odd-looking duckling hatched from the fourth egg.\n\n14\n00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,520\n\"Guji Guji,\" he said, and that became his name.\n\n15\n00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:39,700\nMother Duck taught her four ducklings how to swim, how to dive and how to waddle.\n\n16\n00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:49,140\nGuji Guji always learned more quickly than the others, He was bigger and stronger, too.\n\n17\n00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,260\nBut no matter how quick they were, or what they looked like, Mother Duck loved all her ducklings the same.\n\n18\n00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:09,820\nThen one terrible day, three crocodiles came out of the lake. They looked a lot like Guji Guji.\n\n19\n00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:23,139\nThe crocodiles were smiling, and when they laughed with their mouths wide open, the whole world could see their big, pointed teeth.\n\n20\n00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,080\nThe three crocodiles saw Guji Guji and smiled some more.\n\n21\n00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,620\n\"Look at that ridiculous crocodile. He's walking like a duck!\"\n\n22\n00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:42,760\nGuji Guji heard them. \"I am not walking like a duck, I am a duck!\" he explained.\n\n23\n00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:52,979\nThe crocodiles laughed. \"Look at yourself! No feathers, no beak, no big webbed feet!\n\n24\n00:02:52,979 --> 00:03:05,599\nWhat you have is blue-gray skin, sharp claws, pointed teeth and the smell of bad crocodile. You're just like us.\"\n\n25\n00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:17,909\nThe first crocodile said, \"Your blue-gray body lets you hide under water without being seen so you can get close to fat, delicious ducks.\"\n\n26\n00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:28,379\nThe second crocodile said, \"Big, sharp claws help you hold fat, delicious ducks tightly so they don't get away.\"\n\n27\n00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:39,589\nThe third crocodile said, \"Pointed teeth are necessary so you can chew fat, delicious ducks. Mmmm. Yum.\"\n\n28\n00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:45,319\nThe three crocodiles grinned. \"We know you live with the ducks.\n\n29\n00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:53,489\nTake them to the bridge tomorrow and practice diving. We'll wait underneath with our mouths open wide.\"\n\n30\n00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:59,460\n\"Why would I do that?\" Guji Guji asked. \"Why should I listen to you?\"\n\n31\n00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,800\n\"Because we are all crocodiles, and crocodiles help each other.\"\n\n32\n00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,100\nThe bad crocodiles grinned again and vanished into the grass.\n\n33\n00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,600\nGuji Guji felt terrible. He sat by the lake to think.\n\n34\n00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,580\n\"Is it true? Am I a bad crocodile too?\"\n\n35\n00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,889\nHe looked down into the lake and a made a fierce face.\n\n36\n00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:39,900\nGuji Guji laughed. He looked ridiculous. \"I am not a bad crocodile. Of course, I'm not exactly a duck either.\"\n\n37\n00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:51,280\n\"But the three crocodiles are nasty, and they want to eat my family. I must think of a way to stop them.\"\n\n38\n00:04:52,300 --> 00:05:01,920\nGuji Guji thought and thought until finally he thought up a good idea. He went home happy and content.\n\n39\n00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:12,699\nThat night, the three bad crocodiles sharpened their pointed teeth, all the while thinking of fat, delicious ducks.\n\n40\n00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,279\nThey were ready for their feast.\n\n41\n00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:24,819\nThe next day, Guji Guji did as he'd been told-- he took the flock of ducks to the bridge to practice diving.\n\n42\n00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:30,689\nThe three bad crocodiles were waiting for the ducks underneath the bridge.\n\n43\n00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:36,820\nIt wasn't fat, delicious ducks that dropped from the bridge though;\n\n44\n00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,280\nit was three big, hard rocks! The crocodiles bit down.\n\n45\n00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,660\n\"Crack! Crack! Crack!\" went their pointed teeth.\n\n46\n00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:57,269\nThe three bad crocodiles ran as fast as they could. In barely a minute, they were nowhere to be seen!\n\n47\n00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:05,040\nGuji Guji had saved the ducks! Guji Guji was the duck hero of the day!\n\n48\n00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,100\nThat night, all the ducks danced and celebrated.\n\n49\n00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,540\nGuji Guji continued to live with Mother Duck, Crayon, Zebra and Moonlight,\n\n50\n00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,300\nand every day he became a stronger and happier \"crocoduck.\"\n\n51\n00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,880\nThe end.",

It's brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:22,880\nI'm Annette Bening and I'm here today to read The Tooth, written by Avi Slodovnik and illustrated by Manon Gauthier.\n\n3\n00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,380\nMarissa's love of candy finally caught up with her.\n\n4\n00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:34,840\nThat morning she woke up with a toothache and instead of bringing her to school, her mother took her to the dentist.\n\n5\n00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:42,720\nMarissa didn't often go downtown. Columns of tall, gray buildings cast great shadows across the streets.\n\n6\n00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:50,270\nThe sky, usually bright and blue, was barely visible between the rows of endlessly tall skyscrapers.\n\n7\n00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,420\nMarissa and her mother walked hand-in-hand toward the dentist's office.\n\n8\n00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:04,559\nMen and women wearing long coats and long faces, their collars up and their heads down, rushed in every direction.\n\n9\n00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,030\nMarissa leaned closer to her mother.\n\n10\n00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:13,250\nWhen they stopped at the corner for the light to change, Marissa noticed something unusual.\n\n11\n00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:21,000\nA man with a large nose and dark eyes was sitting on a grate in the sidewalk.\n\n12\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,580\nIn front of him was an open shoebox with money inside.\n\n13\n00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:33,770\nMarissa had never seen anyone like him. She wanted to take a closer look but her mother held her hand tightly.\n\n14\n00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,920\nAs they crossed the street to the dentist's building, Marissa looked back and watched the man over her shoulder.\n\n15\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nHe sat quietly, watching the people pass him by.\n\n16\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000\nUp in the dentist's office they checked in with the receptionist who told them to sit in the waiting room until the dentist was ready to see them.\n\n17\n00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,200\nMarissa's mother sat on the couch crossing her legs and flipped through a magazine.\n\n18\n00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:08,030\nInstead of reading a book or playing with a toy, Marissa looked out the window to the busy street below.\n\n19\n00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,860\nThe man was still sitting on the grate. Most people walked by the man.\n\n20\n00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,919\nSome people, just a few, dropped coins into his shoebox.\n\n21\n00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,220\nOne man in a hurry actually stepped over the man.\n\n22\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,499\nFinally, after a long wait, Marissa was called into the examination room.\n\n23\n00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:34,369\nShe sat in the big chair and opened her mouth as wide as she could.\n\n24\n00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:40,989\nThe dentist saw a small, brown hole in Marissa's tooth.\n\n25\n00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,239\n\"That's quite a cavity,\" he said, \"the tooth will have to come out.\"\n\n26\n00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,960\nA few minutes later, the dentist pulled out Marissa's tooth.\n\n27\n00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,420\nMarissa wished she was in school.\n\n28\n00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,340\n\"Here's your tooth, Marissa,\" said the dentist, slipping the tiny tooth into a small, orange envelope.\n\n29\n00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,800\n\"Make sure to put it under your pillow,\" said her mother.\n\n30\n00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,619\n\"Make sure you brush your teeth twice a day, and especially after candy,\" said the dentist.\n\n31\n00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,899\nThey left the dentist's office and in the elevator Marissa asked her mother,\n\n32\n00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:20,409\n\"Is there really a tooth fairy?\"\n\n33\n00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,920\nOutside the dentist's office, the air was cool.\n\n34\n00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,360\nMarissa tickled the place her tooth had been with her tongue. It felt funny.\n\n35\n00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:37,059\nThey crossed the street. The man was still sitting on the sidewalk.\n\n36\n00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:42,579\nMarissa tried to get closer, but her mother held her hand tightly, like before.\n\n37\n00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:51,300\nMarissa pulled away and went up to the shoebox. There wasn't a lot of money inside.\n\n38\n00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:59,120\nMarissa held open the orange envelope and let the tooth drop into the shoebox.\n\n39\n00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,159\n\"Put it under your pillow tonight,\" she told the man, \"and there will be money there tomorrow.\"\n\n40\n00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:17,820\nAt first the man looked surprised. Then he smiled warmly and waved goodbye to Marissa as she and her mother walked away.\n\n41\n00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,240\nNow, all he needed was a pillow.\n\n42\n00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:41,240\nI used to read books to my kids all the time. They're too big now, but I hope you have a chance to talk to your teachers or maybe your mom or your dad about the book.\n\n43\n00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:51,500\nI think it's a really thoughtful book. Starts out being a trip to the dentist and it ends with a little girl meeting a homeless man.\n\n44\n00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,240\nAnyway, I hope you liked it, I did.",

		"title"		: "Sophie's Masterpiece",
		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,119\nHello, welcome to Storyline Online brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:17,600\nI'm CCH Pounder and today I'm reading Sophie's Masterpiece by Eileen Spinelli. The illustrations are by Jane Dyer.\n\n3\n00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,800\nIt's a spider's tale.\n\n4\n00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,519\nSophie was no ordinary house spider. Sophie was an artist.\n\n5\n00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,880\nShe spun webs more wondrous than anyone had ever seen.\n\n6\n00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,720\nHer playmates called her incredible. Her mama was proud.\n\n7\n00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,640\nSomeday, they said, she's going to spin a masterpiece.\n\n8\n00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,760\nWhen Sophie arrived at the age when a young spider must strike out on her own, she moved to Beekman's Boardinghouse.\n\n9\n00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:04,860\nThe first thing she did was look around. She saw dull green walls, faded rugs, and old window shades. The place cried out for her talents.\n\n10\n00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:13,180\nSophie set to work. Her first project was to weave a web of curtains for Beekman's front parlor.\n\n11\n00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:20,040\nDay after day she whizzed along, blending a golden thread of sun into her silk.\n\n12\n00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:33,500\nThen one day the landlady noticed her and screamed, \"I'll have no spiders in my parlor!\" She swatted at Sophie with a dust rag.\n\n13\n00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:43,660\nSophie knew when she wasn't wanted. She scampered across the wall and up the stairs into the tugboat captain's closet.\n\n14\n00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:52,220\nWhen she finally settled down, she looked around and saw nothing but gray. Gray shirts. Gray pants. Gray sweaters.\n\n15\n00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:59,360\nThe captain needs a new suit, Sophie decided. Something bright. Blue. Like sky.\n\n16\n00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,540\nShe began to spin patiently. A sleeve. A collar.\n\n17\n00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,420\nOne day the tugboat captain caught Sophie at work. He screeched, \"A spider!\"'\n\n18\n00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:18,979\nThen he climbed onto the windowsill and out onto the roof. Sophie did not want anyone falling off the roof on her account.\n\n19\n00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:25,650\nShe scuttled out of the closet, down the hall, and into the cook's bedroom slipper.\n\n20\n00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,340\nCook's bedroom slippers were patched and dirty.\n\n21\n00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,209\nI'll spin Cook a new pair, Sophie thought. After I rest a bit.\n\n22\n00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:45,460\nNo sooner had Sophie snuggled into the toe, than she was being flung to the floor. Was it an earthquake? No.\n\n23\n00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:53,940\nIt was Cook who had shaken Sophie out. \"Yuck!\" scowled Cook. \"Look at that ugly, disgusting spider.\"\n\n24\n00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,800\nSophie's feelings were hurt. With great dignity she journeyed across the rug and under Cook's door.\n\n25\n00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,800\nShe made the long, long climb up the steep stairs to the third floor where a young woman lived.\n\n26\n00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,820\nWearily Sophie slipped into the young woman's knitting basket and fell asleep.\n\n27\n00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,860\nBy this time, many spider years had passed. Sophie was older.\n\n28\n00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,560\nShe only had energy to spin a few small things for herself...\n\n29\n00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:36,899\n…a tiny rose-patterned case for her pillow, eight colorful socks to keep her legs warm. But mostly, she slept.\n\n30\n00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,600\nThen one day the young woman discovered Sophie.\n\n31\n00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:51,700\nOh, no, thought Sophie, close to tears. She knew she did not have the strength for any more journeys.\n\n32\n00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,380\nBut the young woman did not swat at Sophie with a dust rag. She did not climb on the roof.\n\n33\n00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,560\nShe did not say that Sophie was ugly. She simply smiled.\n\n34\n00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,120\nAnd without disturbing Sophie in the least, the young woman picked up her needle and yarn.\n\n35\n00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,940\nSophie watched as the young woman knitted, day after day.\n\n36\n00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:24,080\n\"Booties!\" cried Sophie. The young woman was going to have a baby.\n\n37\n00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,800\nAfter the booties were finished, the young woman knitted a baby sweater. Then the yarn was gone.\n\n38\n00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,440\nThe young woman did not have enough money to buy yarn for a baby blanket.\n\n39\n00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,420\n\"Never mind,\" the landlady said. \"There's an old brown quilt in the hall closet. Your baby can use that.\"\n\n40\n00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:53,000\nSophie had seen that quilt. It was scratchy and drab. Not fit for a baby.\n\n41\n00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,100\nSophie knew the answer. She had to spin a blanket herself.\n\n42\n00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,320\nIn her younger days, this would not have been a problem. But Sophie had grown frail and weak.\n\n43\n00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,700\nThe baby was due any day. Could Sophie complete the blanket in time?\n\n44\n00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:20,570\nShe climbed out of the yarn basket. She traveled to the wide windowsill. Strands of moonlight fell into the room.\n\n45\n00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:29,520\nExcellent! She thought. I'll weave these strands into the baby's blanket. Some starlight, too.\n\n46\n00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,640\nSophie began. As she spun, new ideas came to her.\n\n47\n00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:46,420\nShe worked them into the blanket. Snippets of fragrant pine... wisps of night... old lullabies... playful snowflakes...\n\n48\n00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:54,180\nSophie spun without blinking. Or eating. Or sleeping.\n\n49\n00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:03,700\nShe was never more exhausted. Or determined. On and on she spun.\n\n50\n00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:11,400\nShe was down to the farthest corner of the blanket when she heard the cry of the young woman's newborn baby.\n\n51\n00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:23,020\nAnd there, on that farthest corner, is where Sophie wove into the blanket her very own heart.\n\n52\n00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:33,620\nThat night as the young woman was about to cover her infant with the landlady's quilt, something on the windowsill caught her eye.\n\n53\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:47,200\nIt was a blanket, so soft, so beautiful as to be fit for a prince. The young woman knew this was no ordinary blanket.\n\n54\n00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:57,740\nShe placed it with love and wonderment around her sleeping baby. And went to sleep herself with her hand upon the little spider's last spinning.\n\n55\n00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,040\nSophie's masterpiece.\n\n56\n00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560\nThe End.",

Cut into ring\n\n15\n00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,220\n2. Deep-fried\n\n16\n00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,040\n\"I'm soaking in boiling grease, but I love it!\"\n\n17\n00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,600\n3.

Maybe she's not a morning doughnut,\" Arnie supposed.\n\n31\n00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,420\nIt was 6 A.M. and the baker had just hung the OPEN sign in the window.\n\n32\n00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,900\nArnie was fascinated as he watched customers stream into the bakery.\n\n33\n00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,800\nOne by one, doughnuts were chosen, placed in paper bags, and whisked away with their new owners.\n\n34\n00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,600\nSome went by the dozen in giant boxes.\n\n35\n00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,760\n\"Goodbye!\" Arnie yelled to each doughnut.\n\"Have a great trip!\"\n\n36\n00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,660\n\"This is so exciting! I wonder who will choose me?\"\n\n37\n00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,280\nJust then, Arnie looked up and saw a man pointing right at him!\n\n38\n00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,500\n\"Moi?\"\n\n39\n00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,100\nBefore he could say another word, he was pulled from the tray and placed in a paper bag of his very own.\n\n40\n00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,420\n\"Thank you, Mr. Bing. Have a nice day!\"\nArnie heard the baker say to the man.\n\n41\n00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,540\n\"Mr. Bing... that's a fine name,\" Arnie decided. \"I can hardly wait to meet him!\"\n\n42\n00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,180\n\"Good-bye Arnie!\"\n\"We'll miss you!\"\n\n43\n00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,120\n\"I should have talked to him while I had the chance.\"\n\n44\n00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,800\nThe ride to Mr. Bing's apartment was a little bumpy.\n\n45\n00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,700\nArnie was grateful for the soft napkin the baker had so thoughtfully placed underneath him in the bag.\n\n46\n00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,420\nHe had never ridden in a car and wished he could look out the window to see all the sights.\n\n47\n00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,340\nBut more than anything, he wished he could meet Mr. Bing.\n\n48\n00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,160\n\"Why does he keep me in this bag?\" Arnie wondered.\n\n49\n00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,280\nFinally, the car came to a stop and they were home.\n\n50\n00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,200\nMr. Bing carefully removed Arnie from his paper bag and placed him on a clean, shiny plate.\n\n51\n00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,100\n\"What a handsome plate,\" Arnie said to himself.\n\n52\n00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,700\n\"I'm not crazy about the design-- I prefer a more modern look. But it's nothing a little paint can't fix.\"\n\n53\n00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,440\nMr. Bing gently lifted Arnie from his new plate.\n\n54\n00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,520\n\"Isn't that cute?\" thought Arnie, as he closed his eyes and smiled. \"He wants to hold me.\"\n\n55\n00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,760\nAs Arnie relaxed in Mr. Bing's hand, he felt himself moving higher and higher away from his plate.\n\n56\n00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:06,920\nWhen he opened his eyes to see where he was going, he discovered that he was headed straight for Mr. Bing's open mouth!\n\n57\n00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,520\n\"What are you doing?\" shouted Arnie.\n\n58\n00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,300\nMr. Bing was stunned. He dropped Arnie back onto the plate.\n\n59\n00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,520\n\"I was going to... eat you,\" he replied in shock.\n\n60\n00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,440\n\"Eat me?\" Arnie shrieked, his sprinkles flying everywhere.\n\n61\n00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,340\n\"Why would you do a thing like that? Do you make a habit of eating all your houseguests?\"\n\n62\n00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,460\n\"No... of course not.\"\n\n63\n00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,040\n\"So, why then did it suddenly occur to you to eat me?\" Arnie demanded.\n\n64\n00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,640\n\"Well... because... you're a doughnut.\n\n65\n00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,140\nThat's what doughnuts are for-- to eat.\"\n\n66\n00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,440\n\"Do you mean to tell me you've done this before?\"\n\n67\n00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,320\n\"Yes... I eat a doughnut every day,\" Mr. Bing said sheepishly.\n\n68\n00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,820\nArnie froze. He felt sick and frightened\n\n69\n00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,540\n\"I'd better get out of here before he tries to eat me again!\"\n\n70\n00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,620\nand angry!\n\n71\n00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,700\n\"My friends have probably all been eaten!\"\n\n72\n00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,280\nHe thought to himself for a moment.\n\n73\n00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:17,920\n\"I must put a stop to this right away! I'll call the bakery and warn the others. Whoever's left, that is!\"\n\n74\n00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,740\nArnie knew that there was no time to waste and that he needed to be very sneaky in order to keep his plan from Mr. Bing.\n\n75\n00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,760\nHe turned to Mr. Bing and said in his sweetest voice,\n\n76\n00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:37,380\n\"Excuse me, sir, but I don't believe we've been properly introduced. My name is Arnie.\"\n\n77\n00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,980\n\"Um... hello... Arnie,\" Mr. Bing stammered.\n\n78\n00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,440\n\"I'm Mr. Bing. It's nice to eat you-- I mean meet you.\"\n\n79\n00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:58,960\n\"Mr. Bing, would you be a dear and allow me to use your telephone?\" Arnie asked extra politely.\n\n80\n00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,820\n\"Oh... well, okay,\" said Mr. Bing, and he handed Arnie the phone.\n\n81\n00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,660\nAs quickly as he could, Arnie dialed the number of the bakery.\n\n82\n00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,820\n\"Downtown Bakery, home of the best--\"\n\n83\n00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:19,060\n\"Mr. Baker Man!\" Arnie frantically whispered. \"This is Arnie the doughnut. Do you remember me?\n\n84\n00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,280\nYou made me at 5:15 this morning, and I was bought about twenty minutes ago\n\n85\n00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520\nby a man who goes by the name of Mr. Bing.\"\n\n86\n00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,880\n\"Yes, Arnie,\" the baker answered. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n87\n00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,940\n\"Now, I don't want to alarm you, but just moments ago, that man tried to eat me!\n\n88\n00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,760\nAnd not only that-- he claims to have eaten hundreds of us!\n\n89\n00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,760\nI'm going to make a run for it, but I wanted to warn you so that if you see him coming into the bakery again, you can stop him!\"\n\n90\n00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:54,920\n\"Oh my, Arnie-- I thought you understood. That's why I make doughnuts... for people to eat.\"\n\n91\n00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:02,300\n\"I can't believe it!\" Arnie gasped. \"Are the other doughnuts aware of this arrangement?\"\n\n92\n00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,320\n\"Well, I think so,\" the baker said. \"Let me ask them to make sure.\"\n\n93\n00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,120\nThe baker yelled to the other doughnuts, \"Do you doughnuts know that you're going to be eaten?\"\n\n94\n00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,000\n\"Yes, we know!\" the doughnuts shouted back.\n\"We're delicious! I don't blame them.\"\n\n95\n00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,160\n\"Did you hear that, Arnie?\" the baker asked.\n\n96\n00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,500\nArnie was crushed. The phone dropped from his hand.\n\n97\n00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,980\nHe'd heard all he needed to hear.\n\n98\n00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,420\nArnie forgot all about his plan to escape.\n\n99\n00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,480\nHe collapsed back onto the plate, glanced up at Mr. Bing, and muttered,\n\n100\n00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,760\n\"All right then, let's get this over with. Go ahead and eat me.\"\n\n101\n00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:54,240\nMr. Bing gazed down at Arnie. \"I'm not going to eat you, Arnie,\" he said reassuringly.\n\n102\n00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,000\n\"I just wouldn't feel right about it now.\"\n\n103\n00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,860\n\"Really?\" Arnie said, with a huge sigh of relief.\n\n104\n00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,620\n\"Well, I'm glad to see that you've come to your senses!\"\n\n105\n00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,840\n\"But since I'm not going to eat you,\" Mr. Bing continued, \"I'll have to figure out something else to do with you.\n\n106\n00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,900\nI paid good money for you-- I don't want to be wasteful.\"\n\n107\n00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,140\n\"Of course not!\" Arnie agreed.\n\n108\n00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:24,520\n\"What we need to do is each make a list of things I can do with you instead of eating you.\n\n109\n00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,480\nBetween the two of us, I know we'll come up with something.\"\n\n110\n00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:36,040\n\"Good plan, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie said. \"This will be a breeze-- I bet I'm good at lots of stuff!\"\n\n111\n00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,140\nThey both feverishly wrote down their ideas.\n\n112\n00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,940\nWhen they were finished, Mr. Bing asked, \"Would you like to read yours first?\"\n\n113\n00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,720\n\"Sure thing, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie answered.\n\n114\n00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320\nThings Mr. Bing can Do with Me Instead of Eating Me\n\n115\n00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,600\n\"Do you need a ballroom dance partner?\"\n\n116\n00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,240\n\"No, I don't dance.\"\n\n117\n00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300\n\"You could use a personal fitness trainer.\"\n\n118\n00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,580\n\"Hmm, I'd get too sweaty.\"\n\n119\n00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,120\n\"How about a portrait painter?\"\n\n120\n00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,560\n\"Oh, heavens no!\"\n\n121\n00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,440\n\"Would you like me to entertain you at parties?\"\n\n122\n00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,980\n\"Doughnut make my brown eyes bluuue...\"\n\n123\n00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,080\n\"I don't like throwing parties.\"\n\n124\n00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,620\n\"I could be your chauffeur.\"\n\n125\n00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,920\n\"But you can't see over the steering wheel.\"\n\n126\n00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680\n\"I'd make a great bodyguard!\"\n\n127\n00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,160\n\"Who could you protect me from-- a cookie?\"\n\n128\n00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,940\n\"All righty, Mr. Bing. Let's hear what you came up with!\"\n\n129\n00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,860\n\"Okey-dokey,\" he replied. \"I just know you'll like some of these.\"\n\n130\n00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,400\nThings I Can Do with Arnie Instead of Eating Him\n\n131\n00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,660\n\"I could use you as a pincushion.\"\n\n132\n00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,480\n\"Ooh, too painful!\"\n\n133\n00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,760\n\"How about an air freshener for my car?\"\n\n134\n00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880\n\"How about not?\"\n\n135\n00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,840\n\"Would you like to be a picture frame?\"\n\n136\n00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000\n\"I can't imagine so.\"\n\n137\n00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760\n\"I need a new bowling ball.\"\n\n138\n00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,880\n\"Well, don't look at me!\"\n\n139\n00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,400\n\"You'd make a fine paperweight.\"\n\n140\n00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,420\n\"Boring!\"\n\n141\n00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,120\n\"What about a doorstop?\"\n\n142\n00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,460\n\"Try again.\"\n\n143\n00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,880\nBut there was nothing else on Mr. Bing's list. They were both completely out of ideas.\n\n144\n00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,660\nArnie and Mr. Bing were exhausted. They felt terribly disappointed.\n\n145\n00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,620\nAfter a few minutes of awkward silence, Mr. Bing finally spoke.\n\n146\n00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,320\n\"I'm sorry, Arnie-- but it's clear that we can't agree on anything for you to do around here.\n\n147\n00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,800\nThis is difficult for me to say, but I think it would be best if you found another home.\"\n\n148\n00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,460\n\"I know,\" said Arnie, fighting back tears. \"I'll just be on my way then.\n\n149\n00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,660\nIs it all right if I keep this napkin to pack up all my loose sprinkles?\"\n\n150\n00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,420\n\"Of course,\" Mr. Bing replied sadly.\n\n151\n00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,560\n\"As soon as I get a job, I'll pay you back the money you spent on me.\"\n\n152\n00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800\n\"That's not necessary, Arnie.\"\n\n153\n00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,680\nArnie shook Mr. Bing's hand and thanked him for his kindness.\n\n154\n00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,980\nMr. Bing opened the door, and as Arnie left he paused and said,\n\n155\n00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,600\n\"I guess doughnuts really are only good for eating, aren't they?\"\n\n156\n00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,120\nThey both waved good-bye and Arnie was gone.\n\n157\n00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360\nMr. Bing stood at the window and watched as Arnie walked away.\n\n158\n00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:22,940\nHe walked past the flower beds, the mailboxes, and the apartment manager's office.\n\n159\n00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,100\n\"Is there anything worse than a sad pastry?\"\n\n160\n00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:35,100\nHe passed the tennis court, the swimming pool, and the clubhouse.\n\n161\n00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,200\n--\"Oh my gosh, is that a doughnut?\"\n\n162\n00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:48,040\nBut when Arnie reached the \"No Dogs Allowed\" sign at the end of the driveway, Mr. Bing suddenly came up with a new idea.\n\n163\n00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,380\n\"Arnie! Wait up! Arnie!\" yelled Mr. Bing as he ran after him.\n\n164\n00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,480\nArnie turned back and stopped. When Mr. Bing caught up with him, he was out of breath.\n\n165\n00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,520\n\"I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier!\" Mr. Bing panted.\n\n166\n00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,800\n\"Arnie, I've always wanted a dog--\n\n167\n00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,140\n\"Keep talkin', big guy.\"\n\n168\n00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,020\n\"--and could never have one because they're not allowed here.\n\n169\n00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,100\nBut there's no sign that says \"No Doughnuts Allowed.\"\n\n170\n00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,240\nArnie perked up when he realized what Mr. Bing was thinking.\n\n171\n00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,000\n\"Would you like to take walks and play fetch?\" Mr. Bing asked excitedly.\n\n172\n00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,760\n\"You bet I would!\"\n\n173\n00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,760\n\"Can you do tricks, like rolling over?\"\n\n174\n00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,180\n\"Rolling over? Look at me-- I was made for rolling over!\"\n\n175\n00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:39,480\n\"Well, then, there's only one thing left to ask. Arnie, will you be my doughnut-dog?\"\n\n176\n00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,180\n\"Oh, Mr. Bing-- I would love to be your doughnut-dog!\"\n\n177\n00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,280\nFrom that moment on, Arnie and Mr. Bing were inseparable.\n\n178\n00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,200\nArnie liked being a doughnut-dog even better than he liked being a doughnut!\n\n179\n00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,200\n\"Arf! Arf! Arf!\"\n\n180\n00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,740\nHe went through a short phase of chewing on furniture and barking at the mailmain,\n\n181\n00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,360\nbut after a crash course in obedience school, he graduated first in his class.\n\n182\n00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:13,420\nEverywhere the two of them went, people would stop to pet Arnie. No one had ever seen a doughnut-dog before.\n\n183\n00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,180\n--\"Oh, what a darling man.\"\n--\"What a darling dog!\"\n\n184\n00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,940\nArnie and Mr. Bing had so much fun together.\n\n185\n00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,980\nArnie was the best pet Mr. Bing could ever have hoped for-- and Mr. Bing was Arnie's best friend.\n\n186\n00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,740\nThe end.\n\n187\n00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:41,120\nI chose this book because it illustrates that two people who come from very different backgrounds,\n\n188\n00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,620\nthe eater and the eat-ee--\n\n189\n00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,840\n-- can come together and compromise.\n\n190\n00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,280\nAnd decide that together, eating doesn't need to take place at all, they can just be friends.\n\n191\n00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,420\nSometimes, you're the eater. Sometimes, you're the eaten.\n\n192\n00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,620\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n193\n00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,680\nHope you enjoyed it.\n\n194\n00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,940\nPlease feel free to check out some of our other terrific stories.\n\n195\n00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,900\nKeep reading, keep watching, keep eating.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,760\nWelcome to BookPALS Storyline Online brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,740\nMy name is Camryn Manheim. You may know me from \"The Practice,\" but I hope not, because it was on way past your bedtime.\n\n3\n00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:22,900\nToday I am going to read \"Enemy Pie,\" written by Derek Munson and illustrated by Tara Calahan King.\n\n4\n00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,500\nIt should have been a perfect summer.\n\n5\n00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,380\nMy dad helped me build a tree house in our backyard. My sister was at camp for three whole weeks.\n\n6\n00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,110\nAnd I was on the best baseball team in town.\n\n7\n00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,040\nIt should have been a perfect summer. But it wasn't.\n\n8\n00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:50,000\nIt was all good until Jeremy Ross moved into the neighborhood, right next door to my best friend Stanley.\n\n9\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,920\nI did not like Jeremy Ross.\n\n10\n00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,060\nHe laughed at me when he struck me out in a baseball game. He had a party on his trampoline, and I wasn't even invited.\n\n11\n00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:09,940\nBut my best friend Stanley was. Jeremy Ross was the one and only person on my enemy list.\n\n12\n00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:17,600\nI never even had an enemy list until he moved into the neighborhood. But as soon as he came along, I needed one.\n\n13\n00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,540\nI hung it up in my tree house, where Jeremy Ross was not allowed to go.\n\n14\n00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,840\nDad understood stuff like enemies. He told me that when he was my age he had enemies too.\n\n15\n00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,840\nBut he knew a good way to get rid of them. I asked him to tell me how.\n\n16\n00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:42,210\n\"Tell you how? I'll show you how!\" he said. He pulled a really old recipe book off the kitchen shelf.\n\n17\n00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,340\nInside, there was a worn-out scrap of paper with faded writing. Dad held it up and squinted at it.\n\n18\n00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,800\n\"Enemy Pie,\" he said, satisfied.\n\n19\n00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,110\nYou may be wondering what exactly is in Enemy Pie. I was wondering, too.\n\n20\n00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,820\nBut Dad said the recipe was so secret, he couldn't even tell me.\n\n21\n00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,739\nI decided it must be magic. I begged him to tell me something– anything.\n\n22\n00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:18,149\n\"I will tell you this,\" he said. \"Enemy Pie is the fastest known way to get rid of enemies.\"\n\n23\n00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:27,069\nNow, of course, this got my mind working. What kinds of things– disgusting things– would I put into a pie for an enemy?\n\n24\n00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,300\nI brought Dad some weeds from the garden, but he just shook his head.\n\n25\n00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,859\nI brought him earthworms and rocks, but he didn't think he needed those.\n\n26\n00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,060\nI gave him the gum I'd been chewing on all morning. He gave it right back to me.\n\n27\n00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,060\nI went out to play alone. I shot baskets until the ball got stuck on the roof.\n\n28\n00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,560\nI threw a boomerang that never came back to me.\n\n29\n00:02:52,569 --> 00:03:02,019\nAnd all the while, I listened to the sounds of my dad chopping and stirring and blending the ingredients of Enemy Pie.\n\n30\n00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,939\nThis could be a great summer after all.\n\n31\n00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:09,860\nEnemy Pie was going to be awful.\n\n32\n00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,069\nI tried to imagine how horrible it must smell, or worse yet, what it was going to look like.\n\n33\n00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:23,700\nBut when I was in the backyard, looking for ladybugs, I smelled something really, really, really good,\n\n34\n00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,120\nand as far as I could tell, it was coming from our kitchen. I was a bit confused.\n\n35\n00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,340\nI went in to ask my Dad what was wrong, Enemy Pie shouldn't smell this good. But Dad was smart.\n\n36\n00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:43,360\n\"If Enemy Pie smelled bad, your enemy would never eat it,\" he said. I could tell he'd made Enemy Pie before.\n\n37\n00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,060\nThe buzzer rang, and Dad put on the oven mitts and pulled the pie out of the oven.\n\n38\n00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,500\nIt looked like plain old pie. It looked good enough to eat!\n\n39\n00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,979\nI was catching on.\n\n40\n00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,180\nBut still, I wasn't really sure how this Enemy Pie worked. What exactly did it do to enemies?\n\n41\n00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,760\nMaybe it made their hair fall out, or their breath stinky. Maybe it made bullies cry.\n\n42\n00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,999\nI asked Dad, but he was no help.  He wouldn't tell me a thing.\n\n43\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,820\nBut while the pie cooled, he filled me in on my job.\n\n44\n00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:26,300\nHe talked quietly. \"There is one part of Enemy Pie that I can't do. In order for it to work, you need to spend a day with your enemy.\n\n45\n00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,480\nEven worse, you have to be nice to him. It's not easy.\n\n46\n00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,440\nBut that's the only way that Enemy Pie can work. Are you sure you want to go through with this?\"\n\n47\n00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,700\nOf course I was. It sounded horrible. It was scary. But it was worth a try.\n\n48\n00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,199\nAll I had to do was spend one day with Jeremy Ross, then he'd be out of my hair for the rest of my life.\n\n49\n00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,289\nI rode my bike to his house and knocked on the door.\n\n50\n00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:57,040\nWhen Jeremy opened the door, he seemed surprised.\n\n51\n00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,960\nHe stood on the other side of the screen door and looked at me, waiting for me to say something.\n\n52\n00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,020\nI was nervous. \"Can you play?\" I asked. He looked confused.\n\n53\n00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:16,099\n\"I'll go ask my mom,\" he said. He came back with his shoes in his hand. His mom walked around the corner to say hello.\n\n54\n00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,360\n\"You boys stay out of trouble,\" she said, smiling.\n\n55\n00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,680\nWe rode bikes for a while and played on the trampoline.\n\n56\n00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,120\nThen we made some water balloons and threw them at the neighborhood girls, but we missed.\n\n57\n00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,620\nJeremy's mom made us lunch. After lunch we went over to my house.\n\n58\n00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,689\nIt was strange, but I was kind of having fun with my enemy. He almost seemed nice.\n\n59\n00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:46,620\nBut of course I couldn't tell Dad that, since he had worked so hard to make the Enemy Pie.\n\n60\n00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,420\nJeremy Ross liked my basketball hoop. He said he wished he had a basketball hoop, but they didn't have room for one.\n\n61\n00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,880\nI let him win a game, just to be nice.\n\n62\n00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,500\nJeremy Ross knew how to throw a boomerang. He threw it and it came right back to him.\n\n63\n00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,280\nI threw it and it went over my house and into the backyard.\n\n64\n00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:16,629\nWhen we climbed over the fence to find it, the first thing Jeremy noticed was my tree house.\n\n65\n00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,620\nMy tree house was my tree house. I was the boss.\n\n66\n00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,520\nIf my sister wanted in, I didn't have to let her. If my dad wanted in, I didn't have to let him.\n\n67\n00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,900\nAnd Jeremy Ross wanted in.\n\n68\n00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,160\n\"Can we go in it?\" he asked.\n\n69\n00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,040\nI knew he was going to ask me that! But he was the top person, the ONLY person, on my enemy list.\n\n70\n00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,680\nAnd enemies aren't allowed in my tree house.\n\n71\n00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,180\nBut he did teach me to throw a boomerang. And he did have me over for lunch. And he did let me play on his trampoline.\n\n72\n00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:54,349\nHe wasn't being a very good enemy.\n\n73\n00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:01,529\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"but hold on.\" \nI climbed up ahead of him and tore the enemy list off the wall.\n\n74\n00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:07,739\nI had a checkerboard and some cards in the tree house, and we played games until my dad called us down for dinner.\n\n75\n00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:12,550\nWe pretended we didn't hear him, and when he came out to get us, we tried to hide from him.\n\n76\n00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,940\nBut somehow he found us.\n\n77\n00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,360\nDad made us macaroni and cheese for dinner– my favorite. It was Jeremy's favorite, too!\n\n78\n00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,800\nMaybe Jeremy Ross wasn't so bad after all.\n\n79\n00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,720\nI was beginning to think that maybe we should just forget about Enemy Pie.\n\n80\n00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,200\nBut sure enough, after dinner, Dad brought out the pie. I watched as he cut the pie into eight thick slices.\n\n81\n00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,279\n\"Dad,\" I said, \"It sure is nice having a new friend in the neighborhood.\"\n\n82\n00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:50,509\nI was trying to get his attention and trying to tell him that Jeremy Ross was no longer my enemy. But Dad only smiled and nodded.\n\n83\n00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,880\nI think he thought I was just pretending.\n\n84\n00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:01,540\nDad dished up three plates, side by side, with big pieces of pie and giant scoops of ice cream.\n\n85\n00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,120\nHe passed one to me and one to Jeremy.\n\n86\n00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,500\n\"Wow!\" Jeremy said, looking at the pie, \"my dad never makes pies like this.\"\n\n87\n00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:15,340\nIt was at this point that I panicked. I didn't want Jeremy to eat Enemy Pie!\n\n88\n00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,780\nHe was my friend! I couldn't let him eat it!\n\n89\n00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,220\n\"Jeremy, don't eat it! It's bad pie! I think it's poisonous or something!\"\n\n90\n00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,300\nJeremy's fork stopped before reaching his mouth. He crumpled his eyebrows and looked at me funny.\n\n91\n00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,880\nI felt relieved. I had saved his life. I was a hero.\n\n92\n00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,320\n\"If it's so bad,\" Jeremy asked, \"then why has your dad already eaten half of it?\"\n\n93\n00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,940\nI turned to look at my dad. Sure enough, he was eating Enemy Pie!\n\n94\n00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,580\n\"Good stuff,\" he mumbled through a mouthful. And that was all he said.\n\n95\n00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,840\nI sat there watching them eat Enemy Pie for a few seconds.\n\n96\n00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,880\nDad was laughing. Jeremy was happily eating. And neither of them was losing any hair!\n\n97\n00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,660\nIt seemed safe enough, so I took a tiny taste.\n\n98\n00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,160\nEnemy Pie was delicious!\n\n99\n00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,200\nAfter dessert, Jeremy rode his bike home but not before inviting me over to play on his trampoline in the morning.\n\n100\n00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,800\nHe said he'd teach me how to flip.\n\n101\n00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,560\nAs for Enemy Pie, I still don't know how to make it.\n\n102\n00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,340\nI still wonder if enemies really do hate it or if their hair falls out or their breath turns bad.\n\n103\n00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:41,120\nBut I don't know if I'll ever get an answer, because I just lost my best enemy.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,020\nWelcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:14,440\nI'm Rami Malek, and today I'm going to be reading to you one of my favorite books,\n\n3\n00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,600\nThis is The Empty Pot,\n\n4\n00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,980\nwritten and illustrated by Demi.\n\n5\n00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:30,240\nA long time ago in China there was a boy named Ping who loved flowers.\n\n6\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nAnything he planted burst into bloom. Up came flowers, bushes, and even big fruit trees, as if by magic!\n\n7\n00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:54,720\nEveryone in the kingdom loved flowers too. They planted them everywhere, and the air smelled like perfume.\n\n8\n00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:06,860\nThe Emperor loved birds and animals, but flowers most of all, and he tended his own garden every day.\n\n9\n00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:15,120\nBut the Emperor was very old. He needed to choose a successor to the throne.\n\n10\n00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,380\nWho would his successor be? And how would the Emperor choose?\n\n11\n00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,320\nBecause the Emperor loved flowers so much, he decided to let the flowers choose.\n\n12\n00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,080\nThe next day a proclamation was issued: All the children in the land were to come to the palace.\n\n13\n00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,360\nThere they would be given special flower seeds by the Emperor.\n\n14\n00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,660\n\"Whoever can show me their best in a year's time,\" he said, \"will succeed me to the throne.\"\n\n15\n00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,180\nThis news created great excitement throughout the land!\n\n16\n00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,800\nChildren from all over the country swarmed to the palace to get their flower seeds.\n\n17\n00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:15,140\nAll the parents wanted their children to be chosen Emperor, and all the children hoped they would be chosen too!\n\n18\n00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,680\nWhen Ping received his seed from the Emperor, he was the happiest child of all.\n\n19\n00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,600\nHe was sure he could grow the most beautiful flower.\n\n20\n00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,340\nPing filled a flowerpot with rich soil. He planted the seed in it very carefully.\n\n21\n00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:46,140\nHe watered it every day. He couldn't wait to see it sprout, grow, and blossom into a beautiful flower!\n\n22\n00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,900\nDay after day passed, but nothing grew in his pot.\n\n23\n00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:03,820\nPing was very worried. He put new soil into a bigger pot. Then he transferred the seed into the rich black soil.\n\n24\n00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,400\nAnother two months he waited. Still nothing happened.\n\n25\n00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,800\nBy and by the whole year passed.\n\n26\n00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,300\nSpring came, and all the children put on their best clothes to greet the Emperor.\n\n27\n00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,480\nThey rushed to the palace with their beautiful flowers, eagerly hoping to be chosen.\n\n28\n00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,120\nPing was ashamed of his empty pot.\n\n29\n00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,480\nHe thought the other children would laugh at him because for once he couldn't get a flower to grow.\n\n30\n00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,540\nHis clever friend ran by, holding a great big plant.\n\n31\n00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,780\n\"Ping!\" he said. \"You're not really going to the Emperor with an empty pot, are you?\n\n32\n00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,200\nCouldn't you grow a great big flower like mine?\"\n\n33\n00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:05,420\n\"I've grown lots of flowers better than yours,\" Ping said. \"It's just this seed that won't grow.\"\n\n34\n00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:16,900\nPing's father overheard this and said, \"You did your best, and your best is good enough to present to the Emperor.\"\n\n35\n00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,960\nHolding the empty pot in his hands, Ping went straight away to the palace.\n\n36\n00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,580\nThe Emperor was looking at the flowers slowly, one by one.\n\n37\n00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:41,520\nHow beautiful all the flowers were! But the Emperor was frowning and did not say a word.\n\n38\n00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,780\nFinally he came to Ping.\n\n39\n00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,460\nPing hung his head in shame, expecting to be punished.\n\n40\n00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,920\nThe Emperor asked him, \"Why did you bring an empty pot?\"\n\n41\n00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:12,180\nPing started to cry and replied, \"I planted the seed you gave me and I watered it every day, but it didn't sprout.\n\n42\n00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,620\nI put it in a better pot with better soil, but still it didn't sprout!\n\n43\n00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,940\nI tended it all year long, but nothing grew.\n\n44\n00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:33,280\nSo today I had to bring an empty pot without a flower. It was the best I could do.\n\n45\n00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:45,220\nWhen the Emperor heard these words, a smile slowly spread over his face, and he put his arm around Ping.\n\n46\n00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:57,140\nThen he exclaimed to one and all, \"I have found him! I have found the one person worthy of being Emperor!\n\n47\n00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,480\n\"Where you got your seeds from, I do not know. For the seeds I gave you had all been cooked.\n\n48\n00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,900\nSo it was impossible for any of them to grow.\n\n49\n00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,640\n\"I admire Ping's great courage to appear before me with the empty truth,\n\n50\n00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:26,940\nand now I reward him with my entire kingdom and make him Emperor of all the land!\"\n\n51\n00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:47,900\nWhat I love about The Empty Pot is it does allow me to look inside and realize just how much truth means.\n\n52\n00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:57,000\nBecause ultimately the only consequences are feeling like you're courageous, and honorable, and a bigger person,\n\n53\n00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,520\nand I guarantee you, the truth always wins.\n\n54\n00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,340\nSo thank you to The Empty Pot for such a strong message. Keep telling the truth.\n\n55\n00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,060\nThank you guys for watching Storyline Online. Make sure to check out all of our stories.\n\n56\n00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,940\nKeep watching and definitely keep reading.",

Where y'at?\" the musicians would call.\n\n26\n00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,940\nAll day long I could see brass bands parade by my house while my neighbors danced along.\n\n27\n00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,680\nI loved these parades during Mardi\nGras because they made everyone\n\n28\n00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,180\nforget about their troubles for a little while.\n\n29\n00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:25,180\nPeople didn't have a lot of money in \nTremé, but we always had a lot of music.\n\n30\n00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:32,180\nI listened to all these sounds and mixed them together, just like how we make our food.\n\n31\n00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:39,140\nWe take one big pot and throw in sausage, crab,\nshrimp, chicken, vegetables, rice–\n\n32\n00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,620\nwhatever's in the kitchen–and stir it\nall together and let it cook.\n\n33\n00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,060\nWhen it's done, it's the most delicious taste\nyou've ever tried.\n\n34\n00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,140\nWe call it gumbo, and that's what\nI wanted my music to sound like–\n\n35\n00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,420\ndifferent styles combined to create\nmy own musical gumbo!\n\n36\n00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,400\nBut first I needed an instrument.\n\n37\n00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,360\nThe great thing about music is that you don't even need a real instrument to play.\n\n38\n00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,400\nSo my friends and I\ndecided to make her own.\n\n39\n00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,160\nWe might have sounded different\nfrom the real brass bands,\n\n40\n00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,840\nbut we felt like the greatest musicians of Tremé.\n\n41\n00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,220\nWe were making music\nand that's all that mattered.\n\n42\n00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,320\nThen one day I found a broken trombone that\nlooked too beaten up to make music anymore.\n\n43\n00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:43,800\nIt didn't sound perfect, but finally with a real instrument in my hand, I was ready to play.\n\n44\n00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,280\nThe next time the parade went by my house, I grabbed that trombone and headed out into the street.\n\n45\n00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,900\nMy brother James noticed me playing along and smiled proudly.\n\n46\n00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:04,360\n\"Trombone Shorty!\" he called out because \n the instrument was twice my size. Where y'at?\n\n47\n00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,100\nFrom that day on, everyone called me\nTrombone Shorty!\n\n48\n00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,560\nI took that trombone everywhere I went\nand never stopped playing.\n\n49\n00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,200\nI was so small that sometimes I fell right over to the ground because it was so heavy.\n\n50\n00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,000\nBut I always got back up,\nand I learned to hold it up high.\n\n51\n00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,620\nI listened to my brother play songs over\nand over, and I taught myself those songs, too.\n\n52\n00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:44,120\nI practiced day and night, and sometimes I fell asleep with my trombone in my hands.\n\n53\n00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,040\nOne day my mom surprised me with\ntickets to the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival,\n\n54\n00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,320\nthe best and biggest music festival in town.\n\n55\n00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:01,580\nWe went to see Bo Diddley, who my mom said was one of the most important musicians of all time.\n\n56\n00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:08,460\nAs I watched him onstage, I raised my\ntrombone to my lips and started to play along.\n\n57\n00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,780\nHe stopped his band in the middle\nof the song and asked the crowd,\n\n58\n00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,240\n\"Who's that playing out there?\"\n\n59\n00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680\nEveryone started pointing, but Bo Diddley couldn't see me\n\n60\n00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,540\nbecause I was the smallest one in the\nplace!\n\n61\n00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:30,180\nSo my mom held me up in the air and said,\n\"That's my son, Trombone Shorty!\"\n\n62\n00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,520\n\"Well, Trombone Shorty, come on up here!\"\nBo Diddley said.\n\n63\n00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,200\nThe crowd passed me overhead until I was standing on stage next to Bo Diddley himself!\n\n64\n00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:53,180\nI walked right up to the microphone and held my trombone high up in the air, ready to blow.\n\n65\n00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,940\n\"What do you wanna play?\" Bo Didley asked.\n\n66\n00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,700\n\"Follow me,\" I said.\n\n67\n00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,800\nAfter I played with Bo Diddley, I knew I was ready to have my own band.\n\n68\n00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,040\nI got my friends together, and we called ourselves\nthe 5 O'Clock Band,\n\n69\n00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,540\nbecause that was the time we went out to play each day after finishing our homework.\n\n70\n00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,920\nWe played all around New Orleans.\n\n71\n00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:29,480\nI practiced and practiced, and soon my brother James asked me to join his band.\n\n72\n00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,380\nWhen people wondered who the\nkid in his band was, he'd proudly say,\n\n73\n00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,580\n\"That's my little brother, Trombone Shorty!\" Where y'at?\n\n74\n00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:50,600\nAnd now I have my own band, called Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue, named after a street in Tremé.\n\n75\n00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,120\nI've played all around the world, but I\nalways come back to New Orleans.\n\n76\n00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,220\nAnd when I'm home, I make sure to keep my eyes on the younger musicians in town\n\n77\n00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,960\nand help them out, just like my brother did for me.\n\n78\n00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,840\nToday I play at the same New Orleans jazz festival\nwhere I once played with Bo Diddley.\n\n79\n00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,160\nAnd when the performance ends, I lead a parade of musicians around,\n\n80\n00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,060\njust like I used to do in the streets of Tremé with my friends.\n\n81\n00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,420\nWhere y'at?

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,660\nHi guys. I'm Reid Scott.\n\n2\n00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,100\nAnd welcome to Storyline Online presented\nby SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n3\n00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,260\nToday I'm going to be reading you guys \none of my favorite books.\n\n4\n00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,540\nThis is Sylvester and the Magic Pebble\nwritten and illustrated by William Steig.\n\n5\n00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,420\nSylvester Duncan lived with his mother and\nfather at Acorn Road in Oatsdale.\n\n6\n00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,480\nOnce of his hobbies was collecting pebbles\nof unusual shape and color.\n\n7\n00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,080\nOn a rainy Saturday during vacation he found\na quite extraordinary one.\n\n8\n00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,140\nIt was flaming red, shiny, and perfectly round,\nlike a marble.\n\n9\n00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,460\nAs he was studying this remarkable pebble,\n\n10\n00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,620\nhe began to shiver, probably from excitement,\n\n11\n00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,080\nand the rain felt cold on his back.\n\n12\n00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,920\n“I wish it would stop raining,” he said.\n\n13\n00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,140\nTo his great surprise the rain stopped.\n\n14\n00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,080\nIt didn’t stop gradually as\nrains usually do.\n\n15\n00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,740\nIt CEASED.\n\n16\n00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,680\nThe drops vanished on the way down, the\nclouds disappeared, everything was dry,\n\n17\n00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,020\nand the sun was shining as if\nrain had never existed.\n\n18\n00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,920\nIn all his young life Sylvester\nhad never had a wish gratified so quickly.\n\n19\n00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,440\nIt struck him that magic must be at work,\n\n20\n00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,600\nand he guessed that the magic must\nbe in the remarkable-looking red pebble.\n\n21\n00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,580\n(Where indeed it was.)\n\n22\n00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,620\nTo make a test, he put the pebble on the ground\n\n23\n00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,060\nand said, “I wish it would rain again.”\n\n24\n00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,320\nNothing happened.\n\n25\n00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,500\nBut when he said the same thing\nholding the pebble in his hoof,\n\n26\n00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,720\nthe sky turned black,\nthere was lightning and a clap of thunder,\n\n27\n00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,400\nand the rain came shooting down.\n\n28\n00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,770\n“What a lucky day this is!” thought Sylvester.\n\n29\n00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,159\n“From now on I can have anything I want.\n\n30\n00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,040\nMy father and mother can have anything they want.\n\n31\n00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,400\nMy relatives, my friends, and anybody at all\ncan have everything anybody wants!”\n\n32\n00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,340\nHe wished the sunshine back in the sky,\n\n33\n00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,200\nand he wished a wart on his left hind fetlock \nwould disappear, and it did,\n\n34\n00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,660\nand he started home, eager to amaze his father and mother with his magic pebble.\n\n35\n00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,860\nHe could hardly wait to see their faces.\n\n36\n00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,660\nMaybe they wouldn’t even believe him at first.\n\n37\n00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,840\nAs he was crossing Strawberry Hill,\n\n38\n00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,920\nthinking of some of the many, many things he could wish for,\n\n39\n00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:35,220\nhe was startled to see a mean, hungry lion \nlooking right at him from behind some tall grass.\n\n40\n00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,520\nHe was frightened.\n\n41\n00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,320\nIf he hadn’t been so frightened, he could\nhave made the lion disappear,\n\n42\n00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,140\nor he could have wished himself safe at home with his\nfather and mother.\n\n43\n00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,660\nHe could have wished the lion would turn into\na butterfly or a daisy or a gnat.\n\n44\n00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,460\nHe could have wished many things, but he panicked\nand couldn’t think carefully.\n\n45\n00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,320\n“I wish I were a rock,” he said, \nand he became a rock.\n\n46\n00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:09,680\nThe lion came bounding over, sniffed the rock\na hundred times, walked around and around it,\n\n47\n00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,940\nand went away confused, perplexed, puzzled,\nand bewildered.\n\n48\n00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,520\n“I saw that little donkey as clear as day.\n\n49\n00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,120\nMaybe I’m going crazy,” he muttered.\n\n50\n00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:27,040\nAnd there was Sylvester, a rock on Strawberry Hill,\n\n51\n00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,360\nwith the magic pebble lying right beside him on the ground,\n\n52\n00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360\nand he was unable to pick it up.\n\n53\n00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,960\n“Oh, how I wish I were myself again,”\nhe thought, but nothing happened.\n\n54\n00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,220\nHe had to be touching the pebble\nto make the magic work,\n\n55\n00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,640\nbut there was nothing he could do about it.\n\n56\n00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,980\nHis thoughts began to race like mad.\n\n57\n00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,420\nHe was scared and worried.\n\n58\n00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,260\nBeing helpless, he felt hopeless.\n\n59\n00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,080\nHe imagined all the possibilities,\n\n60\n00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,600\nand eventually he realized that his only chance of becoming himself again\n\n61\n00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,420\nwas for someone to find the red pebble\n\n62\n00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,680\nand to wish that the rock next to it would be a donkey.\n\n63\n00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,080\nSomeone would surely find the red pebble —\nit was so bright and shiny —\n\n64\n00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,780\nbut what on earth would make them wish that a rock was a donkey?\n\n65\n00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,440\nThe chance was one in a billion at best.\n\n66\n00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,440\nSylvester fell asleep.\n\n67\n00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,420\nWhat else could he do?\n\n68\n00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,500\nNight came with many stars.\n\n69\n00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,760\nMeanwhile, back at home, Mr. and Mrs. Duncan\npaced the floor, frantic with worry.\n\n70\n00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,980\nSylvester had never come home later than dinner time.\n\n71\n00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,620\nWhere could he be?\n\n72\n00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,780\nThey stayed up all night wondering what had\nhappened,\n\n73\n00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,240\nexpecting that Sylvester would surely turn up by morning.\n\n74\n00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,680\nBut he didn’t, of course.\n\n75\n00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,560\nMrs. Duncan cried a lot and Mr. Duncan did\nhis best to soothe her.\n\n76\n00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,530\nBoth longed to have their dear son with them.\n\n77\n00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,940\n“I will never scold Sylvester again as long\nas I live,” said Mrs. Duncan,\n\n78\n00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,300\n“no matter what he does.”\n\n79\n00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,860\nAt dawn, they went about inquiring of all the neighbors.\n\n80\n00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,080\nThey talked to all the children—the puppies,\nthe kittens, the colts, the piglets.\n\n81\n00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,760\nNo one had seen Sylvester since the day before\nyesterday.\n\n82\n00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,600\nThey went to the police.\nThe police could not find their child.\n\n83\n00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,640\nAll the dogs in Oatsdale went searching for him.\n\n84\n00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,960\nThey sniffed behind every rock and tree\nand blade of grass,\n\n85\n00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,180\ninto every nook and gully of the neighborhood and beyond, but found not a scent of him.\n\n86\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,040\nThey sniffed the rock on Strawberry Hill,\nbut it smelled like a rock.\n\n87\n00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,940\nIt didn’t smell like Sylvester.\n\n88\n00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,520\nAfter a month of searching the same places\nover and over again,\n\n89\n00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,780\nand inquiring of the same animals over and over again,\n\n90\n00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,100\nMr. and Mrs. Duncan no longer knew what to do.\n\n91\n00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,080\nThey concluded that something dreadful must\nhave happened,\n\n92\n00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,180\nand that they would probably never see their son again.\n\n93\n00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,480\n(Though all the time he was less than a mile away.)\n\n94\n00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,820\nThey tried their best to be happy, to go about\ntheir usual ways.\n\n95\n00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,960\nBut their usual ways included Sylvester and\nthey were always reminded of him.\n\n96\n00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,430\nThey were miserable.\n\n97\n00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,280\nLife had no meaning for them any more.\n\n98\n00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,460\nNight followed day and day followed night\nover and over again.\n\n99\n00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,600\nSylvester on the hill woke up less and less often.\n\n100\n00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,980\nWhen he was awake, \nhe was only hopeless and unhappy.\n\n101\n00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,960\nHe felt he would be a rock forever \nand he tried to get used to it.\n\n102\n00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,220\nHe went into an endless sleep.\n\n103\n00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,340\nThe days grew colder.\n\n104\n00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,750\nFall came with the leaves changing color.\n\n105\n00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,010\nThen the leaves fell and the grass bent to\nthe ground.\n\n106\n00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,340\nThen it was winter.\n\n107\n00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,350\nThe winds blew, this way and that.\n\n108\n00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,889\nIt snowed.\n\n109\n00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:01,410\nMostly, the animals stayed indoors, living\non the food they had stored up.\n\n110\n00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:08,900\nOne day a wolf sat on the rock that was Sylvester\nand howled and howled because he was hungry.\n\n111\n00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,720\nThen the snows melted.\n\n112\n00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,720\nThe earth warmed up in the spring sun and\nthings budded.\n\n113\n00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,380\nLeaves were on the trees again.\n\n114\n00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,320\nFlowers showed their young faces.\n\n115\n00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,180\nOne day in May, Mr. Duncan insisted that his\nwife go with him on a picnic.\n\n116\n00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,410\n“Let’s cheer up,” he said.\n\n117\n00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:38,000\n“Let us try to live again and be happy even\nthough Sylvester, our angel, is no longer with us.”\n\n118\n00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,500\nThey went to Strawberry Hill.\n\n119\n00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,720\nMrs. Duncan sat down on the rock.\n\n120\n00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,060\nThe warmth of his own mother sitting on him\nwoke Sylvester up from his deep winter sleep.\n\n121\n00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,480\nHow he wanted to shout, “Mother! Father!\nIt’s me, Sylvester, I’m right here!”\n\n122\n00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,400\nBut he couldn’t talk.\n\n123\n00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,060\nHe had no voice.\n\n124\n00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,880\nHe was stone-dumb.\n\n125\n00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,560\nMr. Duncan walked aimlessly about while Mrs.\nDuncan set out the picnic food on the rock —\n\n126\n00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,660\nalfalfa sandwiches, pickled oats, sassafras salad,\ntimothy compote.\n\n127\n00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,200\nSuddenly Mr. Duncan saw the red pebble.\n\n128\n00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,139\n“What a fantastic pebble!” he exclaimed.\n\n129\n00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,820\n“Sylvester would have loved it for his collection.”\n\n130\n00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,030\nHe put the pebble on the rock.\n\n131\n00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,710\nThey sat down to eat.\n\n132\n00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,680\nSylvester was now as wide awake as a donkey\nthat was a rock could possibly be.\n\n133\n00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,480\nMrs. Duncan felt some mysterious excitement.\n\n134\n00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,360\n“You know, Father,” she said suddenly,\n\n135\n00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,260\n“I have the strangest feeling that our dear Sylvester is still alive and not far away.”\n\n136\n00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,899\n“I am, I am!”\n\n137\n00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,880\nSylvester wanted to shout, but he couldn’t.\n\n138\n00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,570\nIf only he had realized that the pebble resting\non his back was the magic pebble!\n\n139\n00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,820\n“Oh, how I wish he were here with us on\nthis lovely May day,” said Mrs. Duncan.\n\n140\n00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,260\nMr. Duncan looked sadly at the ground.\n\n141\n00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,820\n“Don’t you wish it too, Father?” she said.\n\n142\n00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,880\nHe looked at her as if to say, “How can\nyou ask such a question?”\n\n143\n00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,980\nMr. and Mrs. Duncan looked at each other with\ngreat sorrow.\n\n144\n00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,680\n“I wish I were myself again, I wish I were\nmy real self again!” thought Sylvester.\n\n145\n00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,320\nAnd in less than an instant, he was!\n\n146\n00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,640\nYou can imagine the scene that followed—\nthe embraces, the kisses, the questions, the answers,\n\n147\n00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,270\nthe loving looks, and the fond exclamations!\n\n148\n00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,640\nWhen they had eventually calmed down a bit,\nand had gotten home,\n\n149\n00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,980\nMr. Duncan put the magic pebble in an iron safe.\n\n150\n00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,700\nSome day they might want to use it, but really,\nfor now, what more could they wish for?\n\n151\n00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,190\nThey all had all that they wanted.\n\n152\n00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,540\nThe End.\n\n153\n00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:10,660\nI love this book because first I remember\nmy grandmother reading this to my little sister.\n\n154\n00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,930\nMy grandmother was a huge influence on me.\n\n155\n00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,880\nShe was an English professor who had an incredible\nlibrary\n\n156\n00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,320\nand I would spend my summers with my grandmother in Lake George, New York.\n\n157\n00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,000\nOn a rainy days I'd go into her library and\nI would just start picking books\n\n158\n00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440\nso books became my friend at a very young age\n\n159\n00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,860\nand this book I remember my sister loved how my grandmother read it.\n\n160\n00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,680\nThe voices, the story and the message of it\nis really cool too\n\n161\n00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,920\nthat we don't have to look very far to find the things that make us the most happy.\n\n162\n00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,340\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n163\n00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,340\nMake sure to check out all of our stories\nand remember keep watching and keep reading.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:06,439\nHi, Welcome to the Screen Actors Guild Foundation BookPALS.\n\n2\n00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:11,379\nI'm Amanda Bynes, you may know me from \"All That,\" or Nickelodeon's \"The Amanda Show,\" or  \"Big Fat Liar.\"\n\n3\n00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,020\nToday I'm going to be reading a story about a dog, and I have two dogs so I thought it was a pretty cool idea.\n\n4\n00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,560\nIt's called \"The Night I Followed the Dog.\" It's written and illustrated by Nina Laden.\n\n5\n00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:29,960\nI have a dog. Nothing exotic or special, just an ordinary dog. In fact I always thought he was a boring dog.\n\n6\n00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,000\nWhat I mean is he can fetch, roll over and shake hands, but mostly he sleeps and eats.\n\n7\n00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,300\nI used to think that our nextdoor neighbors had the best dog in the world.\n\n8\n00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,940\nTheir dog can sing and change the channels on the TV. Their dog always wins medals in obedience school.\n\n9\n00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,720\nBut I don't think their dog is so great now. Not since the night I followed my dog.\n\n10\n00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,900\nEvery night I let my dog out and he runs off into the darkness with his tail wagging.\n\n11\n00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,760\nThe next morning, I let him in and he heads straight for the food bowl.\n\n12\n00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:13,680\nBut one morning I knew something was funny, when I opened the door a little bit earlier than usual and I saw my dog jump out of a limousine wearing a tuxedo.\n\n13\n00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,520\nBefore I could look twice, he disappeared into the backyard and I opened the kitchen door and whistled.\n\n14\n00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,560\nWhen he came into the house he was the same as he always is. Hungry!\n\n15\n00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,960\nI really wasn't sure if I believed what I had seen.\n\n16\n00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,920\nSo that night I decided to follow him.\n\n17\n00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:39,100\nI wore dark clothing so I wouldn't be noticed, and I left my bicycle near the door so I'd have it close by.\n\n18\n00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,700\nWhen I let the dog out, I slipped out too. I took out the garbage so he wouldn't suspect anything.\n\n19\n00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,220\nThe dog went straight to his doghouse.\n\n20\n00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,660\nI saw a light go on inside. Slowly I snuck around the backyard and peeked into the doghouse.\n\n21\n00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,680\nThis is not the doghouse that I had helped build.\n\n22\n00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,000\nInside there was a living room, a bathroom, and a huge closet full of fancy clothes.\n\n23\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,140\nThe dog was in the bathroom. He was wearing a tuxedo and fumbling with a bowtie.\n\n24\n00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,600\nWhen he came out, he casually walked out of the doghouse, across the yard, and down the street.\n\n25\n00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,560\nI grabbed my bicycle and followed him. Two blocks later, I saw a limousine pull over.\n\n26\n00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,420\nThe dog got in and the car took off. I started peddling faster.\n\n27\n00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,560\nThe car headed across town. I thought I would lose them, but luckily they were stopped by a few red lights.\n\n28\n00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,839\nAfter a while, I found myself in a part of town that I'd never seen before.\n\n29\n00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,760\nThe buildings all seemed to be empty and it was very quiet. The limousine stopped.\n\n30\n00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,720\nI hid and watched my dog get out. He disappeared into a building and the limousine pulled away.\n\n31\n00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,540\nThere was nothing on the outside of the building, just two brass fire hydrants on either side of the entrance.\n\n32\n00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:02,380\nI opened the door. At the end of the hall there was a neon sign that said The Dog House. I crept closer.\n\n33\n00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,100\nIt looked like some kind of club. I decided to get a closer look.\n\n34\n00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:14,120\nThe moment I opened the door, two mean-looking bulldogs appeared and said, \"You can't come in here.\"\n\n35\n00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:21,700\nI didn't know what to say, so I said, \"But, but... I saw my dog. I mean, I think my dog's in here.\"\n\n36\n00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,460\nJust then, my dog walked over and said, \"It's okay boys, he's with me.\"\n\n37\n00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,600\nThe bulldog said, \"Sure boss, uh, whatever you say boss.\"\n\n38\n00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,920\nFor a minute, it seemed like forever, I waited.\n\n39\n00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:43,099\nThen my dog said, \"I knew you'd find out eventually. Well, now you know. This is my place.\"\n\n40\n00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,760\nI looked around. Finally I asked, \"What is this place?\"\n\n41\n00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,169\nMy dog said, \"This, this is a place where dogs come after a hard day.\n\n42\n00:03:54,169 --> 00:04:02,360\nIt's a place where we can relax. It's a place where we can talk about our problems with the mailman or with the poodle next door.\n\n43\n00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,760\nSee all the sofas? We can sit on the sofas here. We can get treats without having to lie down, roll over, or play dead.\n\n44\n00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,740\nAnd if we want to chew on a shoe or chase our tail, no one will stop us.\n\n45\n00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:25,780\nWe have no masters here, no leashes, and no rolled-up newspapers. This, this is a place where dogs can be dogs.\"\n\n46\n00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:34,080\nWe sat down. A cocker spaniel came by and asked me if I would like a bowl of water or some biscuits.\n\n47\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,639\nLittle by little dogs of all kinds started coming in.\n\n48\n00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:46,000\nSome danced. Some talked. They all looked at me a little funny, but when they saw who I was with, they smiled and shook my hand.\n\n49\n00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,600\nAt one point, my dog waved to an Afghan with a camera. She came over to our table and took a picture of us together.\n\n50\n00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,560\nBeing with my dog made me feel like a movie star.\n\n51\n00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,940\nJust when I was really starting to enjoy myself, I looked at my watch.\n\n52\n00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,460\nI told my dog I had to leave or I'd get in trouble. He nodded.\n\n53\n00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,840\nI think he was about to say something, but a glamorous greyhound grabbed his paw and whisked him onto the dance floor.\n\n54\n00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,719\nAs he was getting up, he tossed me the photo of the two of us.\n\n55\n00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,500\nThen he bowed slightly and disappeared into the crowd.\n\n56\n00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,340\nIt was way past my bedtime.\n\n57\n00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:35,280\nAs I peddled home into the cool night, I thought to myself, \"Now I'm really going to be in the doghouse. But then again, that might not be so bad.\"\n\n58\n00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,000\nThe End.\n\n59\n00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,820\nWhat'd you think? Yeah, I thought it was really great, too. I should go home and read this to my dogs.",
