		"text"		: "Gulliver: Ooh, ouch! Hey! Help! Get off me!! Where am I?\nGulliver narrator: I'm lying on my back. I'm being pricked by lots of tiny sharp things. My arms and legs are tied to the ground – even my long hair is fastened.\nGulliver: I… can't… move!\nGulliver narrator: It's the strangest sight! Hundreds of tiny figures are prodding me with miniature spears. Others are fastening bits of string and hammering tiny pegs into the ground. The tiny figures are…\nGulliver: …humans?\nGulliver narrator: Yes little ones, no higher than six inches tall!\nGulliver: I must be dreaming!\nGulliver narrator: I shut my eyes and open them again. No… I'm not dreaming – I'm tied to the ground – I'm well and truly a prisoner.\nMy name is Gulliver. This story of my travels to distant lands may seem unbelievable, and in places, disturbing – but the lands I visited and the strange peoples I met are not imaginary, I didn't make them up. Please listen and remember… it is all true. \nSailor: Dr Gulliver… the men, the men are feeling sick…\nGulliver narrator: I was a ship's doctor. We'd set sail from Bristol in England in 1699 and were heading for the East Indies. I'd left my wife and two children behind. A violent storm broke out…\n…in the strong winds, we were shipwrecked on a large rock close to land.\nI swam, battling with huge waves. \nOn reaching the shore, I pulled myself up on some soft grass and fell asleep, exhausted.\nAnd there, during the night I became a prisoner of the tiny people. I was so amazed when I saw the tiny human creatures prodding me that I roared and they all ran back terrified. They started to shoot arrows from their bows – onto my hands, my body… my face…\nThe arrows pricked me like hundreds of needles. I struggled violently and snapped the strings on my left arm and quickly covered my eyes to protect them.\nGulliver: No more… Stop!\nGulliver narrator: I fell back and lay still. Once they realised I wasn't going to attack them or move, they stood back and waited.\nOne of them, wearing fine clothes, so clearly important, ventured forward from the crowd.\nGulliver: Ah… Sir… Now… Don't worry… I'm not going to eat you… But…\nGulliver narrator: I pointed to my mouth…\nGulliver: I'm very hungry… I need food… food!\nGulliver narrator: The one in charge nodded his head.\nA few minutes later ladders were put against my body and a long line of tiny people mounted them, carrying dishes of meat, baskets of tiny loaves of bread, and small barrels of wine slung over their shoulders.\nGulliver: This is… very good…!\nGulliver narrator: I ate and drank greedily. Those tiny morsels of food and drink were some of the most exquisite food I have ever tasted. The tiny natives were amazed at my appetite.\nWith my stomach full, I promptly nodded off.\nWhen I woke up, I was moving. I later found out that the wine I had drunk had contained a sleeping drug and whilst I was sleeping, 900 of the tiny natives had lifted me onto a machine which was being pulled by a thousand tiny horses. I was taken to the city to meet the king, who greeted me warmly…\nHe was young and dignified, with strong features. He gave a long speech to me in his language, but I did not understand a word. But he pointed to the city and his people, with a sweep of his arm.\nKing: … Lilliput…\nGulliver narration: Some courtiers were also there. One had a wise and scholarly look and made friendly gestures to me. Her name, I later learnt, was Flimnap. She was the King's secretary. Another, who had a rather mean expression, drew his sword at various points and waved it in a rather threatening way in the air at me. This was Skyresh.\nI was then transported to an empty, ruined temple, where I was lifted up with pulleys and chained to the gates. I was still a prisoner, but at least now I could, at last, stand up.\nAnd so it was that I became a guest in the kingdom of Lilliput with its tiny inhabitants. The ruined temple became my home. The royal family came regularly to watch me from the tower. The King sent 30 scholars to teach me the Lilliputian language, which I learnt very quickly.\nOne night I couldn't sleep. I heard the whisper of voices close by. It was the King with his courtiers Flimnap and Skyresh… What Skyresh said worried me deeply…\nSkyresh: I think that we should kill him…\nKing: Why do you say that, Skyresh?\nSkyresh: He eats too much, your Majesty! It is costing us a fortune and if we continue to feed him like this, we'll have a famine in Lilliput.\nKing: How do you suggest we kill him?\nSkyresh: Starve him!\nFlimnap: That's barbaric!\nSkyresh: Or we could shoot him with poisoned arrows.\nKing: What do you think, Flimnap?\nFlimnap: He is a giant and the decay of his body could cause a plague which could spread throughout the kingdom.\nKing: That's very true… He asks for his freedom every day.\nSkyresh: It's too dangerous! He could kill all of us!\nFlimnap: He has so far been gentle and well behaved towards the people of Lilliput. He could be useful to us…\nWe can give him his freedom with certain conditions…\nKing: …which would be?\nFlimnap: He becomes our ally in our war against Blefuscu and destroys their fleet.\nKing: Flimnap, you're right! We are facing a grave danger and this giant Gulliver could save us!\nGulliver narrator: I had heard enough. Lilliput was on the brink of war. The King would not kill me whilst I was useful to him, but what if he changed his mind? I had to escape!",

		"text"		: "Blefuscu captain: Pull those sails down quickly, lads! There's a good wind today… We'll give those Lilliputians a surprise. Oh, we'll be celebrating tonight…\nBoy: Aye, aye sir… eh… What? Cap'n! Cap'n! Quick… Look! Look!\nBlefuscu captain: What's up, boy? What's the problem? Seen a ghost?\nBoy: Not a ghost. A… a… giant! He's huge… he's coming this way… walking through the waves!\nBlefusucu captain: Holy smoke! He's the size of a mountain! Abandon ship! Abandon ship!\nGulliver narrator: Yes. I, Gulliver, was crossing the stretch of water between Lilliput and the island of Blefuscu, half swimming, half wading, carrying ropes and iron hooks.\nI had a plan to save Lilliput from invasion by the islanders of Blefuscu – it was dangerous, but I had made a promise to the king in return for my freedom.\nSkyresh, the chief admiral and my enemy, brought me the news.\nSkyresh: The King has agreed to set you free.\nGulliver: Yippeee! Thank you, Skyresh. That's fantastic news!\nSkyresh: Against my advice, mind you… And there is a price.\nGulliver: Oh… What is that?\nSkyresh: I have the contract written here: \"Conditions to be promised by the Man-Mountain in return for his freedom. One: He shall not leave Lilliput without permission… Two: When a messenger has to travel a long way, they may ask…\n\"Finally, he shall help us in our war against Blefuscu.\"\nGulliver: Ble… fu…?\nFlimnap: Blefuscu. The kingdom of Blefuscu lies to the north-east of ours. Its inhabitants are our deadly enemies. At this very moment their navy is preparing to invade us.\nGulliver: What are you fighting over? Land? Religion?\nSkyresh: Eggs.\nGulliver: Eggs?!\nSkyresh: Yes, here on Lilliput, we believe that eggs should be cracked at the small end. This is because our King's grandfather cut his finger when breaking an egg at the big end. But over in Blefuscu they crack their eggs at the big end. It's an outrage and an insult. Those so-called Big-Endians across the sea are our enemies now.\nGulliver: I… understand.\nGulliver narrator: This seemed the strangest of reasons to go to war, and yet… in my own country there had been stranger causes of wars.\nSkyresh: Before we unlock your chain, you must promise to obey these rules.\nGulliver narrator: I had no choice.\nGulliver: I, Lemuel Gulliver do solemnly swear to defend the state of Lilliput and do all I can to destroy the Blefuscu navy.\nSkyresh: One more thing: if you break any of the conditions in the contract, the consequences will be serious. We'll be watching you.\nGulliver narrator: And so at last, I was free from my chains and could walk about the island as I wished.\nI went to the coast to see how I could escape from Lilliput. But all I could see were miles and miles of ocean. But in the distance there was one small, rocky island – Blefuscu!\nThey were getting ready to attack Lilliput. It was time to honour my promise to defend the island. A bold plan appeared in my mind…\nGulliver: Flimnap, I need some of your strongest rope and your heaviest iron bars.\nFlimnap: That is a strange request.\nGulliver: You will see… Trust me. I have a plan. I can save Lilliput.\nFlimnap: Very well. I trust you, Gulliver.\nGulliver: You're a good woman and a true friend, Flimnap.\nGulliver narrator: I twisted three ropes together into one, so it was like thick cord. I bent the iron bars into hooks and fixed them on the ends of the cords. With these, I strode into the sea. I swam for half an hour, and then, when the Blefuscu harbour came into view, I waded with the ropes behind me…\nWhen the Blefuscu sailors saw me, they were so frightened, they leapt from the ships and swam to shore. There were about 30,000 of them.\nI fixed one of my iron hooks to each empty ship. When the people on the shore realised what I was doing, they fired arrows at me.\nBut I remembered my glasses and put them on to protect my eyes. I then pulled the ships away…\nCrowds were waiting for me at Lilliput harbour as I brought the entire Blefuscu fleet with me there.\nThey called me a hero. The king was delighted and wanted me to help him attack Blefuscu. But I told him that I had promised to defend Lilliput, not to invade Blefuscu and make its people slaves. I persuaded him that it was better to live in peace.\nSoon afterwards, something happened that was to change my life in Lilliput completely. It started in the middle of the night…\nCrowds: Fire! Fire! Help! The palace is on fire!",

Hurry!\nGulliver: What? I'm coming.\nGulliver narrator: The tiny Lilliputians were running here and there, passing buckets of water the size of thimbles. They were useless against the huge flames.\nFlimnap: Quick, Gulliver, you've got to help us! Where's your jacket? You can use it to smother the flames.\nGulliver: I haven't got it! I was in such a rush…\nFlimnap: Oh no.\nGulliver: Wait. I've got an idea! I drank a lot of wine last night and I really need to…\n[sound of rushing water] \nQueen: Ugh! It's splashing on me! What a terrible smell!\nGulliver narrator: The fire was out in minutes. I didn't wait for thanks but hurried home to sleep.\nI was a hero, or so I thought. I learnt much later that the Queen was horrified by the way I'd extinguished the fire, even though Flimnap explained to her that if it hadn't been for me, the palace would have burnt down. She refused to return to her rooms, even though they were thoroughly cleaned, and she swore to have revenge.\nIn the meantime, before I heard how angry the Queen was, I continued to enjoy the hospitality of the Lilliputians. They made me shirts and bed linen. Three hundred cooks prepared my daily food. I ate a lot to impress the King but later learnt that Skyresh used this against me, persuading the King that I was bankrupting the country.\nI got used to my life of comfort in Lilliput and ideas about escape faded away. But late one evening, Flimnap arranged to meet me outside the city walls.\nWe met in secret in the light of the moon.\nFlimnap: Gulliver, you are in serious danger. No one knows I am here. I've come to warn you as you are my friend. Skyresh and the Queen are plotting your downfall. They've drawn up a list of your crimes…\nGulliver: Crimes? What crimes?\nFlimnap: They're accusing you of high treason.\nGulliver: Treason!! But… What did I do against the state? I'm a hero in Lilliput!\nFlimnap: Well…\nGulliver narrator: As I found out, Skyresh had been plotting against me.\nSkyresh: The law clearly states that whoever passes water in the palace is committing an act of high treason…\nFlimnap: Yes, Skyresh, but the palace would have burnt down if Gulliver hadn't urinated on it!\nSkyresh: It was a malicious act, meant to shame the Queen!\nKing: It's true… the Queen is extremely unhappy about the whole situation.\nSkyresh: Yes, your majesty. There are rumours…\nKing: Rumours? About what?\nSkyresh: About Gulliver and the wives of some of the ministers…\nFlimnap: Those are just rumours. There's no proof.\nGulliver narrator: I was outraged.\nGulliver: But I saved the palace. I knew Skyresh hated me from the start. I don't know why…\nFlimnap: Yes, and he hates you even more now you've defeated the Blefuscu navy. He's admiral of the Lilliput fleet and your victory makes him look weak. He now has the support of the Queen and several other ministers. It's serious, Gulliver.\nGulliver: What are they going to do?\nFlimnap: Punish you…\nSkyresh: We'll set his house on fire so that he burns to death. We'll fire poisoned arrows at his face and hands and smear his shirts and sheets with deadly poison so that he dies in agony…\nFlimnap: Your Majesty! He has saved us from invasion!\nKing: It does seem a little harsh, Skyresh. I have always been a fair and just ruler. We won't execute him. We'll just blind him. My doctors will put poisoned arrows into his eyes as he is lying down.\nSkyresh: But your Majesty, we'll still have to feed him! In fact, he might eat more when he's blind…\nKing: We'll feed him less and less each day so that he becomes weak and dies of starvation.\nSkyresh: Very well, your Majesty. There is no time to lose. I will arrange for the blinding to take place in three days…\nGulliver narrator: The King's judgement seemed neither fair nor just. I used to trust the Lilliputians, but now? Time was short.\nAs the sun rose the following day, I swam across to Blefuscu. There on the beach, I spotted… a rowing boat… of my size!\nThe Blefuscans helped me make huge oars and ten days later, I was ready.\nI set off with six tiny cows and sheep in my pockets and not a moment too soon. In the distance I could see the Lilliputian ships setting sail - for Blefuscu! They were coming after me.\nI longed for England and my family. After a day at sea, I spotted an English ship returning from Japan. The captain did not believe my amazing stories, but was amazed when I showed him the miniature sheep and cows.\nOn arriving back in England, I was delighted to be reunited with my family. But as time went on, I wanted to return to the waves and I set sail once again on a new voyage. Little did I know I would soon face terrible horrors…",

		"text"		: "Gulliver narrator: My name is Gulliver. Let me tell you the story of my second voyage, to the strange land of Brobdingnag.\nI had spent the winter in England, but soon became restless. I said farewell to my wife and family to seek my fortune across the sea once more. The wide world waited for me!\nBut sea voyages don't always go to plan. A huge storm blew up. And when it passed, we found ourselves...\nSailor: Land ahoy!\nGulliver narrator: ...at an island.\nSailor: Food and water. We get what we need and set sail. And men, stay armed.\nGulliver narrator: It was barren and rocky. I set off alone to explore, but I found nothing. When I returned to the beach...\nSailor: Run! Back to the boat!\nGulliver: Where are you going?! Stop!\nGulliver narrator: The men were already in back in the boat, rowing for their lives, and... a huge creature was chasing them, like a man, but so... tall. I can't tell you what happened, for I turned and ran for my life...\nI ran into a giant field, where I hid under stalks of corn rising 40 feet into the sky.\nGulliver: What is this place?\nGulliver narrator: I felt sick. Across the field I saw another man-creature, as tall as a church steeple, harvesting the giant corn.\nBrobdingnag farmer: What have we here?\nGulliver: Don't eat me!\nGulliver narrator: He spoke a strange tongue.\nBrobdingnag farmer: [booming voice] Like a little... man.\nGulliver narrator: Just then he scooped me up, close to his face. His breath was foul.\nBrobdingnag farmer: I think the wife would like to see this.\nGulliver narrator: And he tucked me into his coat pocket. How I trembled with fear as he walked back to his house.\nFarmer's wife: [Screams] It's a mouse! Get it out of my kitchen!\nGulliver narrator: The farmer's wife was shocked when she saw me. For there I stood, on their kitchen table, his whole, huge family looking at me.\nFarmer's wife: It's a man! So tiny.\nGlumdalclitch: He must be hungry, mother.\nFarmer's wife: Here, give him some meat.\nGulliver: Oh, thank you.\nGulliver narrator: And they pushed a huge slice of meat my way. With a thimble of ale.\nMy drinking seemed to amuse them. The ale made me a little bolder, and I did a little dance for them. Perhaps they would treat me well... But just then...\n[sfx: baby crying]\nGulliver: What's that?!\nGulliver narrator: A huge baby, that's what it was. Thankfully, the baby soon fell asleep.\nAnd so did I. The farmer's daughter tucked me into bed with a handkerchief for a blanket. It was heavy and rough like the sail of a warship, but I was exhausted.\nGlumdalclitch: Good morning my little man. My name's Glumdalclitch. Glumdalclitch.\nGulliver: Glumdal... Oh, what? Your name? Glumdalclitch?\nGlumdalclitch: Oh, he said my name! He's so cute. I'm Glumdalclitch and you're...?\nGulliver: She's asking my name. I'm Gulliver. Gulliver! \nGulliver narrator: The farmer's daughter must have been only nine or ten years old, and a mere 30 feet tall. She was kind to me and became my closest friend. Over the next days she taught me their language, which I learned fast. Life was good, for a while.\nFarmer: Gulliver! We're going to town. Come here.\nGulliver: To town? Yes, sir, of course.\nGlumdalclitch: Don't worry Gulliver, we're taking you to market, so people can see you. You've become quite famous! Here, I've made this little travelling box.\nGulliver: Why thank you Glumdalclitch.\nGulliver narrator: I climbed inside, and off we went. The journey was bumpy, like rising and falling in a ship in a great storm. Finally we came to a rest, somewhere... indoors.\nFarmer: [To Gulliver] Now then little man, let's see if we can earn ourselves a pretty penny.\n[To the crowd] Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the smallest man in Brobdingnag!\nCrowd: [sfx: gasping]\nGulliver narrator: And the farmer opened the box. Out I stepped onto a table – in a room full of giant people...\nFarmer: Now Gulliver, show them what you can do.\nGulliver: Err, good day to you all! I am Gulliver!\nGulliver narrator: And so I performed for them. I danced, and fenced with my sword… I drank another thimble of ale. The crowd loved me!\nFarmer: That's three crowns each. Next performance, at six o'clock. Thank you Madam... Thank you Sir...\nGulliver narrator: And so it went. The next day we did three shows. Then ten the next. Then 15. I was exhausted. But the farmer kept pushing me. Poor Glumdalclitch tried to stop him. But it was no use.\nGlumdalclitch: Father, he can't go on. He must rest today. He'll die.\nFarmer: Well, if he dies, we'll make no more money. Let's make as much as we can, first.\nGulliver narrator: I lost my appetite. I feared I would die here, in this strange land, miles from home. Oh, if only I had stayed at home in England, none of this would have happened! But just as I thought all was lost... something wonderful happened. I'll tell you about that, next time.",

This is the story of my life in the strange land of Brobdingnag, where I was but the size of a mouse among giants.\nMy master, the farmer who found me, saw me as a way to make money. Every day I was made to perform for the amusement of a crowd. I danced and sang for them. Until one day, I collapsed with exhaustion.\nGlumdalclitch: Gulliver!\nGulliver narrator: That was my dear Glumdalclitch, the farmer's daughter, and my only true friend here.\nGlumdalclitch: He's fainted! Father, I told you it was too much. He'll die.\nFarmer: Don't worry dear, he's fine, aren't you Gulliver?\nGulliver: I'm... I'm OK.\nSladral: Excuse me. I'm here on official business.\nGulliver narrator: Although I was exhausted, I looked up to see a finely dressed man.\nSladral: Will the little man live?\nFarmer: Oh, he's as right as rain.\nSladral: Good. The Queen has heard of this Gulliver, and would like to see him for herself.\nFarmer: Oh, of course my lord. But... well I'm like a father to him. I couldn't...\nSladral: We'll pay you, of course. One thousand gold pieces? And the girl - she will come with us too and live in the palace.\nGulliver narrator: Of course, the greedy farmer agreed without any hesitation. Before I knew it, we were on our way to the palace. I felt relieved.\nSladral: Your Majesty. May I present, Mr Gulliver. Oh, and his maid, Glumdalclitch.\nGlumdalclitch: Your Majesty.\nQueen: Yes, yes, now where is this Gulliver?\nGulliver: Down here, your Majesty. It is an honour. May I kiss your royal foot?\nQueen: He speaks! It's true... Mr Gulliver, you may kiss... my fingertip!\nGulliver: My lady.\nQueen: He's lovely. He will dine with me tonight!\nGulliver narrator: Despite the Queen's beauty and kindness, at dinner I was quite appalled by her behaviour. At one mouthful she ate as much as 12 English farmers would eat in a meal – crunching the wing of a lark, bones and all – though it were nine times the size of a turkey.\nGulliver: Quite an appetite, your Majesty! \nGulliver narration: Not that it mattered. I was happy to rest and eat well. Everyone at court was enchanted by me!\nQueen: Are you enjoying the meat, Gulliver?\nGulliver: Oh certainly, Madam. It's delicious.\nQueen: Oh, have some more.\nGulliver narration: Everyone at court loved me, except that is, the Queen's dwarf.\nDwarf: Pipsqueak.\nGulliver: Pipsqueak? Me?\nGulliver narration: He had lost his position now that he was no longer the shortest man in the kingdom. And he wasn't happy.\nDwarf: Yes. Quite a big meal for a little runt. Just you wait.\nQueen: Gulliver, do hurry and finish supper, I have a present for you!\nGulliver narration: It was a house made by the finest craftsman in the land. It was the perfect size for me, with little chairs and a table, and even a lock to keep out rats. Best of all, laid on my bed, shirts of the finest silk. Though Brobdingnag silk is rather rough for a man of my size.\nLife passed in this way for some time. I was treated like royalty! But in spite of the fine dining and beautiful clothes, life at court was not always so smooth. Especially because of my, adventures...\nQueen: Gulliver, tell them what happened today!\nGulliver: I was attacked by a large fly, your Majesty.\nSladral: Oh Gulliver, we heard you had an accident today?\nGulliver: An apple, Sir. It fell on my back. It almost broke it...\nGulliver narrator: I was getting upset. Even my dear Glumdalclitch seemed to find me funny. I had to get out of the court. I slipped away from everyone, and wandered down a vast hallway.\nDwarf: Psst.\nGulliver: Oh you. Go away, dwarf.\nDwarf: That's no way to speak to a friend. I have just the thing to soothe you after their mockery, Gulliver. Come with me. \nGulliver narrator: I had no choice but to follow him. We arrived in a quiet study. The dwarf scooped me up.\nDwarf: Some dessert, my friend? Or should I say, a just desert for you Gulliver?!\nGulliver: Now, now. What's this?\nGulliver narrator: It was a giant bowl of honey. Over which the dwarf held me...\nGulliver: Hey, we're not enemies. Listen, you're like a big brother to me...\nDwarf: In you go. \nGulliver: No, wait. Please.\n[sfx: splash]\nDwarf: No one will know.\nGulliver narrator: I struggled and struggled, and tried to swim, taking mouthfuls of the sweet honey. But I had been a sailor for many years, and I made it out.\nGulliver: There! Not so easy to stop me, dwarf! \nDwarf: Oh, well done, Gulliver. Such a shame there are so many wasps at this time of year! They do so like honey...\nGulliver narrator: And off he went. From the window, I heard a buzzing sound. Ten large wasps, the size of eagles – were flying towards me!\nGulliver: Take that! And you. Come here, wasp! I've not finished with you.\nGulliver narrator: I fought off the wasps. And collapsed, exhausted.\nLife in Brobdingnag had become very dangerous for me. But how could I escape from this land of giants? I decided I had to meet with the king.",

The land of Lilliput with tiny people, no bigger than my foot... And now this land, Brobdingnag, where I am but a mouse beside the giants who live here.\nAnd today, I was to meet the king of Brobdingnag.\nKing: Welcome, Gulliver. Tell me, how do you like my kingdom?\nGulliver: Your Majesty, your people have been extremely kind to me. I dine on delicious food with the Queen, and live in a beautiful house made just for me. Next week I'll have lived here for one year.\nKing: Well, I see. But...?\nGulliver: But, your Majesty, this is not my home. I miss my own people, and wish to return there.\nKing: Ah yes. The Queen has told me about a place called... England? Tell me, do you have laws in England?\nGulliver: Yes we do. And we have policies too, and political parties... the debates between our parties are magnificent!\nKing: Political parties! But you're so small. Oh, I say!\nGulliver: Yes, we have the Whigs and the Tories.\nKing: And which are you - a Whig or a Tory?\nGulliver narrator: The more I talked about England, the more he just laughed. I needed to tell him something that would impress him – make him realise what a great nation we were. Then I thought of it.\nGulliver: There is one thing we have in England, that you don't have in Brobdingnag, Sir.\nKing: And what's that, little man?\nGulliver: Gunpowder.\nKing: Gunpowder?\nGulliver: Yes, for all your guns.\nKing: Explain.\nGulliver: England's armies are the envy of the world. And the secret of our power is gunpowder. You see, powder is rammed into a hollow iron tube, and then set alight, forcing the ball of metal, through the tube...\nGulliver narrator: The king sat in silence.\nGulliver: We can destroy whole ranks of an army at once, sink down ships, attack cities and tear up their houses. It's glorious. And you can have the secret. I will offer it to you, to enforce your rule.\nKing: I am amazed, Gulliver.\nGulliver: Yes?\nKing: I am amazed at how a little insect like you, can have such inhuman ideas. The blood and desolation you speak of so familiarly, it comes from an evil source. Speak of this gunpowder no more.\nGulliver: No, your Majesty.\nGulliver narrator: I seem to have offended him, for the king nor queen ever invited me back again. Nobody liked me at court. Only my dear friend Glumdalclitch still cared for me.\nGulliver: I need to get home.\nGlumdalclitch: But I love it here Gulliver. I've learned to write, to sing, to sew... and they pay me well. Soon, I'll have saved enough to buy a new farm for Mum and Dad. I don't want to go home, not yet.\nGulliver: But I need to. Walk with me.\nGulliver narrator: Glumdalclitch took me in my travelling box and we set off. Soon the court was far behind us and we walked through the strange land of Brobdingnag. It was vast - at least 6,000 miles across. There was no way I could escape alone. And the island was surrounded by rough seas - so much so, that no other nations ever came to trade here. I was stuck.\nGulliver: What's that? Wait... where... Glumdalclitch!!!!\nGlumdalclitch: Gulliver!!!\nGulliver narrator: I was being carried high into the sky by... a bird! I looked out from my case and yes – a huge eagle was carrying my travelling box in its claws. We went higher and higher – and Brobdingnag grew smaller. And then we were over the sea – I saw the rough waves breaking beneath – before, with a great cry – he dropped my box – right down into the waters. I floated, and floated for hours until I fell asleep on the waters...\nSailor: Hello, anyone there?\nGulliver narrator: English voices? I had been rescued.\nGulliver: It's me, Gulliver! Gosh you're... small!\nSailor: What? And why are you shouting?\nGulliver: Sorry. It's just... you wouldn't believe me.\nGulliver narrator: The journey home took a month, and soon I was nearing my own front door. My dear wife ran out to embrace me.\nGulliver's wife: My... my Gulliver?!\nGulliver: My... dear.\nGulliver narrator: And so my second voyage was at an end. In truth, it took me some time to adjust to life with my own people. I had seen such strange things. Life was not the same.\nGulliver's wife: Promise me you will never go to sea again.\nGulliver narrator: I wish I could. But as you may guess, this was not my unfortunate destiny. On my next voyage, my life changed forever, and I saw the terrible things that man had created.",

		"text"		: "Sailor: Dr Gulliver! I see a ship coming toward us.\nGulliver: Let me look... Pirates! Quick - fill the sails... full speed ahead!\nGulliver narrator: Yes, pirates. They caught us. Luckily, they spared my life but set me adrift in a small canoe with paddles and enough food for only three days.\nI'm Gulliver - and this is my third voyage - to the mysterious land of Laputa.\nOnce again a voyage I'd begun full of hope ended in misfortune. My luck ran out when the pirates arrived, so here I was, floating in a canoe.\nFor three days I saw nothing and no one - just mile upon mile of water and sky. Then I came upon a tiny rocky island and survived there by roasting birds' eggs, eating dried seaweed and drinking from pools of water. My situation seemed hopeless. But one morning... a black shadow crossed the sun and the air went cold. I looked up and there... in the sky, to my amazement, was what looked like a huge mountain slowly moving towards me...\nGulliver: It's an island, floating in the air!\nGulliver narrator: It was about two miles deep, smooth and flat at the bottom. Through my telescope I could make out people moving up and down green slopes...\nNear me, a long line of rope dangled from its edge all the way down to the sea...\nGulliver: They're fishing! ...\nHey! Hello! Over here! Here... Come and rescue me! Hello, hey!\nGulliver narrator: A fisherman leaned over and peered at me. He shouted and more people arrived and pointed at me.\nNot long after, a long chain was winched down with a seat. I climbed in and was gently pulled up. I felt on top of the world.\nI was greeted by some of the strangest-looking mortals I'd ever seen... they had a dreamy, faraway look as if they were thinking about anything but what was in front of them.\nGulliver narrator: I was escorted to the King, though this took a while as my guides kept forgetting where we were going.\nGulliver: Where am I?\nLaputian: Where are... oh, you're... sorry? What did you ask?\nGulliver: Where am I?\nLaputian: Why, Laputa, of course.\nGulliver narrator: The King, too, was deep in thought, seated in front of a table with all kinds of mathematical and astronomical objects. He looked up, but after acknowledging me, then ignored me. It was an hour before he remembered I was there.\nBut now, it seemed, it was finally time to join the king for supper.\nKing: Our food? Does it please you?\nGulliver: It's... um, delicious...\nGulliver narrator: Actually, it was the oddest-looking food I'd ever seen - the meat was cut in the shape of triangles, the bread was shaped like cones and cylinders and the puddings, like flutes.\nKing: The dish you are eating is my favourite - it's like a beautiful symphony. I hope you are enjoying our music... Is your music harmonious like ours?\nGulliver: It is... different. So this land is called, Laputa?\nKing: Oh yes. It is the only part of my kingdom that can fly. We float continuously from one part of the country to the other. We are currently passing over Lagudo, our capital city...\nGulliver narrator: The king told me they were on their way to the Grand Academy of Science and Research in their capital city... He told me the Laputians are great mathematicians and musicians. I had already realised this.\nKing: Would you like to visit the academy? Come with me. \nGulliver narrator: We went onto the balcony and from there I looked down onto the huge city of Laguda. Badly constructed houses with crooked roofs leant to one side. The people were poorly dressed and looked miserable. In the distance I could see a huge building with smoke and strange substances rising from it. This was the famous Academy. \nKing: I have no more time to entertain you. I have to get back to my... thinking. \n[bell] \nLaputian: Yes, your Majesty. \nKing: Send for Lady Monodi. \nLady Monodi will take you to the Academy and be your guide. She is not very intelligent and is quite unfashionable, but she is from Laguda visiting and is very welcoming... \nLaputian: [announcing] Lady Monodi. \nLady Monodi: How can I help you, Your Majesty? \nGulliver narrator: I have to admit that I wasn't really looking forward to visiting Laguda and its crooked Academy guided by an ignorant, unfashionable woman. But when Lady Monodi entered, I quickly changed my mind. She was stunning! Her eyes were bright, intelligent and sparkling, full of curiosity and humour, not vague like those of everyone else on Laputa. \nSuddenly I was glad to be leaving this floating island with its dreamy mathematicians. It was time to explore the Academy. I had no idea what I would find.",

		"text"		: "Scientist A: Yeeess?\nLady Monodi: We're here to look round the Academy… I'm Lady Monodi… and this is Dr Gulliver, from England.\nScientist A: England! Ahh! Land of great mathematicians and astronomers – Isaac Newton – now he is the talk of the Academy at the moment with his theory of gravity… Is it true that it was an apple falling on his head that gave him the idea? \nGulliver: I believe so…\nLady Monodi: I'm sure Gulliver would like to see what goes on in our great Academy…\nGulliver narrator: I was indeed interested to see what went on in the Academy but equally, I was glad to spend more time in the company of Lady Monodi. She was a delightful companion, not ignorant as the King had described her.\nGulliver: Do you visit Lagado often?\nLady Monodi: My husband Lord Monodi spends all his time reading astronomy books and thinking… I get so bored on Laputa… You know, my husband won't even notice I'm gone.\nGulliver: Really?\nLady Monodi: Yes, I prefer it here in Lagado, even though life down here is hard and most people are very poor. It's infinitely preferable to a life of abstract thinking… Don't you think?\nGulliver narrator: I wondered if Lady Monodi was secretly making plans for me… I knew I would have to get away before I fell for her completely. But first, as a doctor, I was keen to see the famous Academy and meet the scientists working there.\nLady Monodi: I'm sure you won't have seen any inventions before like the ones here. They are quite at the cutting edge of science…\nGulliver narrator: Lady Monodi was right. I was totally unprepared for what I was to find.\nLady Monodi: Interesting experiment going on here…\nGulliver narrator: The room we entered had a huge pile of cucumbers in the middle. A woman covered in soot and with scorched hair was holding half a cucumber in her hand. The other blackened half, was on the floor.\nGulliver: And what is your project?\nScientist B: Ah… well, I am extracting sunbeams from cucumbers…\nGulliver: I'm sorry…? Did you say \"extracting sunbeams … from… cucumbers\"?\nScientist B: Yes… That's right… So people can use them to keep warm in winter. A cucumber takes in sunlight to grow, so we should be able to extract the sunlight…\nGulliver: And have you managed to extract any yet?\nScientist B: Well…not quite yet…I think I'm getting very close to it though…\n[SFX: Explosion]\nScientist B: Oh dear!\nGulliver: And how long have you been working on this project? \nScientist B: Oh, only eight years….\nGulliver: Right, I see… Well good luck!\n[To himself] You'll need more than that…\nLady Monodi: Now, you will be very interested in the project in this next room. A very learned physician is conducting an important experiment. He is famous for curing the problem of wind.\nGulliver: Now that could be useful. It's something I suffer from… Perhaps he can help me?\nGulliver narrator: In the room we had just entered there was a dog in the middle of the floor and a man standing over it with some bellows pointing towards the dog's backside.\nGulliver: What are you doing?\nScientist C: Well, if the dog is suffering from a little bit of wind, then using the bellows gently, I draw the bad air out. If the condition is serious, like in the case of this dog… if I squeeze the bellows hard like this… air goes in and out of the dog…\nGulliver: I see…This dog looks pretty dead to me…\nScientist C: Is he? Oh dear! How unfortunate… He may recover if I just… gently squeeze the bellows so I that I can draw out air… like that… Now did I hear you say that you also suffer from wind? 'Cause if you like, I can…\nGulliver: No, I think you must have misheard me… We ought to move on!\nGulliver narrator: We hurried out, leaving the doctor trying to revive the poor dog. We visited several other laboratories all with quite bizarre experiments that frankly, seemed pointless and with little chance of success.\nGulliver: And do they get funding for their experiments?\nMonodi: Yes, of course.\nGulliver: But how can so much money be spent on these pointless, degrading projects…when people are living in such misery?\nMonodi: You're not impressed then?\nGulliver: No, I'm not. These aren't creative projects. They're unhealthy and impractical. What's more – they're immoral – people are starving in the city. Monodi, I've seen enough. I want to go home…\nMonodi: You mean back to Laputa…?\nGulliver: No… to England. Is there a ship that can take me…?\nMonodi: You need to take the ferry to Glubbdubdrib. From there you can get on board a boat for Japan, and then England. I'll be sorry to see you go, Gulliver.\nGulliver: You have been very kind and a great guide. But I have been away many months and I miss my country and my family.\nGulliver narrator: So, I left the beautiful Lady Monodi and sailed first to Glubbdubdrib, which she had forgotten to tell me, was a land of magicians. I had several adventures there, which are quite another tale… From Glubbdubdrib, I went to Japan and boarded a ship to England…\nIt was wonderful to be reunited with my wife and children. I knew, though, that it wouldn't be long before sea life would tempt me once again. Little did I know that even more dangerous adventures lay ahead of me.",

		"title"		: "In the land of the houyhnhnms",
		"text"		: "Gulliver narrator: My name is Gulliver, and this is the story of my travels.\nIt was September 1710. I'd set sail from Portsmouth, but my luck ran out after just a few weeks. My crew rose up against me and mutinied. I was put ashore at the first island we saw.\nOn following a path from the beach, I was relieved to notice some tracks – a few looked human, but most were from horses. So I was not alone – thank goodness!\nAs I passed one field, I saw some animals. They were ugly looking with long beards like goats, and thick ragged hair on their chest and their heads. The rest of their bodies were bare.Some moved towards me and I hurried on. But one of them blocked my way. It raised its filthy claws.\nI swiped at it with my sword.\nGulliver: Out of my way!\nGulliver narrator: I hit the creature and it howled. Within seconds, a herd of the creatures descended on me, their ugly faces leering and spitting…\nSuddenly they all fled.\nGulliver narrator: Then I saw it – a beautiful grey stallion trotting gracefully out of the woods. Its smooth mane and back were gleaming in the dappled sunlight. It was this superb animal that had scared off the creatures.\nGulliver: Here boy… You're a beauty aren't you… Here…\nGulliver narrator: The horse stopped, circled around me, eyeing me all the time. It lifted its head away as I went to stroke it.\nGulliver: Where's your owner then? Won't you let me ride you? – I'm really tired …\nGulliver: Are you trying to say something?\nGulliver narrator: It was as if he was talking to me…\nOut of the trees another horse approached, a brown one. It stopped by us. Then the most extraordinary thing happened! Both horses lifted up their right hooves and touched each other's hoof in greeting.\nI couldn't believe it… They were really talking to each other. They kept glancing at me and then bent their heads together as they communicated.\nThere was no doubt – I definitely heard the word 'yahoo' several times.\nGulliver: Ya… hoo.\nMaster (grey horse): Yahoo.\nGulliver: Gentlemen, I see you are magicians who have taken the shape of horses. Please… take me to your master so I can find some food and drink.\nGulliver narrator: And so they led the way. After a mile, we came to a long, low building, made of logs. But when we went in, there were no people – just a mare and two foals.\nI followed the grey stallion through the door and into a yard. Here, tied up, were two deformed creatures like those I'd seen earlier. They were eating lumps of meat.\nMare: Yahoo?\nGulliver narrator: The stallion picked up some meat and offered it to me, but the smell made me feel sick.\nThen it dawned on me. This creature was a 'yahoo'. That's what the horses called them! They thought I was one of them! A yahoo!\nGulliver: No… no, I'm not a yahoo!\nGulliver narrator: But then I took a closer look at the yahoo. He had two legs and arms … like mine, except his nails were long and shaped like claws. He was… in fact… a man… like me… but … savage!\nIn the following days, I was looked after well by the stallion. It became clear to me that the houyhnhnms, as these horses were called, were no ordinary animals – they had their own language, which they pronounced through the nose and roof of the mouth. I set about learning it and was soon able to talk easily with the grey stallion, whom I called Master. He was a very patient teacher.\nThe houyhnhnms were the kindest, gentlest, most honest and civilized race I'd ever come across. Months passed and I felt healthy and happy to live among them. They saw me as some kind of superior yahoo – they were confused because, although I bore some resemblance physically to those beasts, they thought my clothes were part of my body.\nI told Master where I came from and how I had got to their country, but he could not believe that there was another land beyond the sea or that yahoos could build boats… Nor could he understand when I described our society – where innocent people are killed in wars.    \nGulliver: In England, Master, the horses work in the fields for the people.\nMaster: How can this be? How can there be a country where yahoos are in charge?\nGulliver narration: The more we talked and the more I learnt about their society, the more the failings of my own became clear. And it became clear, I was a yahoo after all.\nMaster: There is something I must tell you, Gulliver… now that I know your secret… There is one question we houyhnhnms, are at this very moment debating… whether we should get rid of the yahoos once and for all.\nGulliver narrator: He said yahoos were vile and dangerous and threatened the peace and tranquillity of his society…\nMaster: I know that you are different to the other yahoos. But there are many who think that you are just one of them…\nGulliver narrator: I knew what that meant. My life was in danger…",

		"title"		: "The journey's end",
		"text"		: "Gulliver: Wow! This feels so good. Hey! Master! Come on in!\nMaster: Sorry, Gulliver… I've got a busy day tomorrow. I need to prepare… I'll wait for you over there in that field…\nGulliver: You don't know what you're missing…\nGulliver narrating: It was so hot that day. We'd just been to see one of the Master's herd of yahoos. He let me go with him when he went to check up on them. I wanted to study them, since it was supposed that I was the same species. I hadn't really taken seriously what the Master had said about the houyhnhnms wanting to get rid of the yahoos. Who would they use to carry things for them and work in the fields?\nI always felt dirty after being near yahoos – they always tried to grab me – so that day I'd stripped off and jumped in the ice water – to cool down and wash their smell off my skin. Little did I know we'd been followed and I was being watched.\nGulliver: Hey… get off me… what are you doing?\nGulliver narrator: She was clawing at me and pulling me to her. I knew exactly what she was trying to do. I could smell her desire…\nMaster: Get off him, you filthy savage.\nGulliver narrator: I felt so ashamed. The Master hauled the young female yahoo off me. She scrambled out of the water and ran off, howling.\nMaster: Are you alright, Gulliver? I heard you shouting.\nGulliver: Yes… I think so.\nMaster: Did she frighten you? She really wanted to…\nGulliver: I know… She thought I was one of them!\nMaster: Gulliver – look at your reflection in the water…\nGulliver narrator: I looked down at my bare arms and bare chest… at the hair on my head. There was no escaping it. I was the lowest beast… a yahoo. I had their body and shape. But I had the soul of a houyhnhnm.\nThree years I'd spent among the houyhnhnms – three wonderful years.\nTheir world was truly based on reason, friendship and kindness. They valued cleanliness and exercise. There were no robbers or murderers. There were no bullies, liars or cheats.\nBy contrast, the yahoos were the filthiest, noisiest, most deformed animal nature had ever produced… and… and I was one of them.\nMaster: Gulliver, I have bad news I'm afraid.\nGulliver: What is it? Has there been a death?\nMaster: No, it's not that – death is not something we houyhnhnms feel sad about… It is part of life… No, it's you. Some houyhnhnms aren't happy that you live with my family. They think it's unnatural. They say you should go and join the yahoos or leave.\nGulliver: What? There is no way I can live with the yahoos… Can't you persuade the assembly that I can live quietly with you? I could be your pet…\nGulliver narrator: He didn't answer for a while. He bent his head.\nMaster: No, Gulliver. I have no power against the assembly's decision. You must go… leave.\nGulliver: But I love it here. I can't go back to England to live with the yahoos there.\nMaster: I know. You have made a lot of progress… but you cannot stay. They have given you just two months to get ready.\nGulliver narrator: When I thought of my family, my friends back home, my countrymen, and the whole human race, I thought of them now as they really were – yahoos in shape and character.\nGulliver: But where will I go? The yahoos in England disgust me now.\nMaster: There is nothing more I can do. Even if I went against the assembly, you couldn't stay. It wouldn't be safe.\nGulliver narrator: I was devastated. But I had no choice.\nOver the next few weeks I made a canoe of wood with the help of some of the houyhnhnms. I filled it with food and drink.\nI said goodbye to the Master and his family. We all cried as I pushed the boat out.\nI decided to look for a deserted island where I could spend the rest of my life in peace, untroubled by yahoos and with memories of the wonderful houyhnhnms.\nI landed on a small rocky island and camped by a small stream. A few days later, I saw a boat in the distance, and quickly hid. Several yahoo sailors came ashore for fresh water. They found me and despite my struggles, took me back to their boat and their captain.\nSpanish sailor: Captain Hernandez, we can't understand what he's saying. He speaks like a horse. I think he's English.\nCaptain: He needs food and drink and sleep. We'll take him back to Cadiz.\nGulliver narrator: The captain was polite and generous, but he wouldn't accept that I wanted to stay on the island. We returned to Spain. I stayed in my cabin the whole time, pretending I was sick, as I could not bear being with any of the crew. Eventually I boarded a ship for England and returned, after being five years away.\nWhen I saw my wife and children, I felt sick. I couldn't bear their yahoo smell… I bought two horses and I kept them in my stable. They have never been ridden. I speak to them for hours each day. They are my friends.\nAlthough I hate all yahoos, I decided to write this account of my journeys over the last sixteen years and seven months so that I might reform the yahoo race, so that I can change them. For this reason, I have told the whole truth. I have seen many worlds.\nThis was a true story.",
